&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Whenever you find yourself saying something for a second time (to a second
audience or in a second situation), it is highly likely that you will send up
saying it again and again in the future. To vastly improve the quality of the
communication and reduce the amount of time that you spend communicating the
information, &lt;em>write it down&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;mdash; Matt Mochary in &amp;ldquo;The Great CEO Within&amp;rdquo;, p. 22&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing the &lt;a class="link" href="https://dailey.page/p/wide-world-of-the-fractional-cto/" >fractional CTO (fCTO)
thing&lt;/a> for about &lt;a class="link" href="https://dailey.page/p/2024-in-retro/" >two
years&lt;/a> now, and I
get quite a few people who ask me about how I got things started. Given the
&lt;a class="link" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>rapid reduction in available software development-related
positions&lt;/a>, it makes
sense that there are quite a few who are considering &lt;a class="link" href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/hang&amp;#43;out&amp;#43;shingle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>hanging out a
shingle&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoy discussing this with folks, but my policy on these things is that if I
find myself repeating the same material, I should probably save myself and
everyone else a lot of time by just writing it down! This is my attempt to do
that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Much of this advice on getting started is really applicable to anyone doing any
kind of consulting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-should-i-get-started">How should I get started?&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="have-the-experience">Have the experience.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t have data on this, but I get the sense that the demand for fractional
leadership has gone up since 2022. Supply has risen to meet that demand.
However, a fair portion of the supply (of fractional leaders) has never actually been in a leadership
position. When I ask clients why they choose to work with me, many of them
have pointed at my experience as both a founder and a leader. A
departmental manager at BigCorp might carve out a reputation as a team leader,
but someone with very little (or no) prior leadership experience might find it
difficult to find a toehold in a crowded market.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="find-a-niche">Find a niche.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One common issue I see with folks getting started is that they make no
real attempts at defining where they can truly add value. I get that it&amp;rsquo;s
tempting to do All The Things when you first get started - after all, you need
to get paid and eat! If you specify a niche (industry, stage of
company, B2B or B2C, SaaS or otherwise, or some combination of these things)
you can start to figure out who you should be marketing and talking to. Speaking
of talking&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="talk-to-a-lot-of-people">Talk to a lot of people.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I get it, sales is hard (especially if you are an introverted engineer-type like
me), but if you&amp;rsquo;re going solo then you&amp;rsquo;re also the salesperson.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The easiest way to figure out how many conversations you need to have is to
take some notes from the SaaS sales playbook. First, figure out what your annual
revenue target is. Next, determine what your average fractional engagement will
net you. (If you&amp;rsquo;re just getting started, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be fuzzy math, but
that&amp;rsquo;s ok! You can adjust this as you get more information.) Keep all of your
opportunities in a CRM (HubSpot&amp;rsquo;s free tier is pretty good for a solo operation)
and use that information to determine what ratio of conversations you have to
close an engagement. Your sample size may be rather small, but again, fuzzy math
is okay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For myself, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that I need to have maybe 2-3 conversations a week with
various folks in my industry. Those are not sales conversations, and they
are very unlikely to end in an engagement. But if I&amp;rsquo;m having conversations with
the right people, each meeting is a person who might know someone else needing
my help. They could be a source for a warm lead.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="have-some-sample-proposals-and-deliverables-ready">Have some sample proposals (and deliverables) ready.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have found it to be useful to have several different sample proposals on hand.
It provides potential clients with an idea of how I approach engagements (clear
terms, flat rates, etc) and makes them more comfortable with the idea of working
with me.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="start-with-projects-before-going-open-ended">Start with projects before going open-ended.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For me, fCTO engagements are completely open-ended. I&amp;rsquo;m only taking on two
clients at a time, and generally they are a day or two (sometimes more) per week
in, for which I am billing a weekly rate. However, that&amp;rsquo;s a lot to sign on for
if you&amp;rsquo;ve not worked with me before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To establish trust, I&amp;rsquo;ll often start a relationship with a well-defined project.
Having a well-scoped project with a discrete (written) deliverable familiarizes
clients with my working style (and me with theirs).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="keep-the-pipeline-going">Keep the pipeline going.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you pick up one or two projects, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get so involved in them that
you forget to keep talking to folks about potential future projects. When you
finish the project, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be in a mad scramble to find your next
engagement.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-do-_not_-you-like-about-being-a-fractional-cto">What do &lt;em>not&lt;/em> you like about being a Fractional CTO?&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="you-do-all-the-things">You do all the things.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Sales. Marketing. Accounting. Bill collection. As a solo practioner, you do &lt;em>all
the things&lt;/em>. That eats into the time that you&amp;rsquo;ll spend doing the thing you love,
but it&amp;rsquo;s part of the deal!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="staying-fresh-requires-intentionality">Staying fresh requires intentionality.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll no doubt learn new things just engaging with clients, but to stay on top
of industry trends (both technology and whatever domain you&amp;rsquo;re working in) you
will have to allocate some time to ongoing self-education. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to skip
this part, but don&amp;rsquo;t! Your continued usefulness &lt;em>depends&lt;/em> on staying current.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="you-trade-depth-for-breadth">You trade depth for breadth.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you&amp;rsquo;re consulting, you rarely get to spend enough time with one
project (maybe 3-6 months for most of my engagements) to go really deep. Instead, you
get exposed to a broad array of industry niches, architectures, languages, and
product categories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a trade-off here. I enjoyed going deep for 13 years (from first line of
code to exit) with Stratasan. I also enjoy the variety inherent to consulting.
Ideally, one could switch between depth and breadth every 5-7 years.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="there-will-be-juggling">There will be juggling.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I take on no more than two fractional engagements at any time due to this. I
also stress to potential clients that it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>fractional&lt;/em>, not &lt;em>interim.&lt;/em> This
means I am not always immediately available, but I do clearly communicate
my availability with all clients via Calendly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-do-you-love-about-fractional-leadership">What do you love about fractional leadership?&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="i-love-strategy">I love strategy.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a fractional chief &lt;em>technology&lt;/em> officer, I would presumably be working on
engineering strategy. However, I find that when I start asking questions I often
start edging into &lt;em>business strategy&lt;/em>, which I love. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing more
satisfying to me than a client asking me to sit in on one of their annual or
quarterly strategic planning sessions!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-love-the-autonomy">I love the autonomy.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I get to choose the clients I work with, and I&amp;rsquo;m fairly picky about it. I only
want to work with companies that I feel I can provide an unusual level of value
(e.g., sticking to my niche of early-ish stage healthcare B2B SaaS). That makes
the work both more satisfying to me and more valuable to my clients.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-love-the-security">I love the security.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Assuming you are able to keep the pipeline going, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more security in
having six or seven ongoing clients (between fractional CTO, advisory, and
project work) rather than putting all your eggs in one basket for a single
company.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-love-the-variety">I love the variety.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I get bored fairly easily, so I love it when I can hit several interesting
engagements in a single year. They will probably be in healthcare, but they
could otherwise be completely unlike (different technology stacks, different
business problems, different company cultures and problems they are facing). I
thrive on this variety.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="parting-thoughts">Parting Thoughts&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you have an appetite for it, I believe fractional leadership can be very
fulfilling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about striking out as an fCTO, there are a lot of resources
already out there to get you going. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to learn everything from
scratch!&lt;/p>

It is full of useless noise, but
it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to keep up with colleagues and interesting people working in my
field. Here are two major frustrations with the platform that diminish its
utility to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Like most social media, the signal-to-noise ratio on LinkedIn is quite low.
Most posts are either self-congratulatory, AI slop, or simply some variation
of an existing Business Meme (&amp;ldquo;I replaced an entire team of developers with
AI!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;SaaS is dead!&amp;rdquo; etc). I wish I could filter my feed down to a subset of
users that I find actually informative. For example, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyasdoshi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Shreyas
Doshi&lt;/a> either writes or shares
excellent content around product management. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardmelendez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ed
Melendez&lt;/a> constantly posts a
highly eclectic variety of things I find interesting. I can follow both of
these people, but since the Feed is algorithmic, I might not see anything they
post for days or weeks and it will be surrounded by useless slop. There&amp;rsquo;s no
way to build an RSS feed for an individual&amp;rsquo;s LinkedIn
activity, so I am simply at the mercy of the almighty algorithm as to when or
where I might see these posts. It probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that as a long-time
LinkedIn user I&amp;rsquo;m connected to thousands of users, making my Feed particularly
noisy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let&amp;rsquo;s say I do see something interesting in my Feed and I leave the post for
another page. When I return to the feed (via a browser &amp;ldquo;Back&amp;rdquo; button)
everything in my Feed is reshuffled and the original item is lost in the
abyss. This is particularly frustrating on a
mobile device where I might be scrolling through the Feed, be interrupted by
an email or something. When I return to the Feed, the page automatically
reloads, losing everything I was looking at and giving me a whole new set of
slop to scroll through.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All in all, I still find LinkedIn useful enough that I continue to visit it on a
fairly regular basis (while successfully ignoring most of the notifications).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still consume most of my content via old-school RSS (via Feedly) and wish that
LinkedIn would make it easier for users to publish content to publicly
accessible feeds. It makes sense that they would want a walled garden with
algorithm-driven content (I assume &amp;ldquo;time on site&amp;rdquo; is some Director&amp;rsquo;s KPI) but
this approach continues to diminish the utility of any content posted on
LinkedIn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to this conflict of incentives, my approach is to post (most) everything I
write both on LinkedIn and on my blog.&lt;/p>

“Of our psychological measures we find intelligence, as measured with Wordsum, to have the largest effect size, negatively predicting belief in astrology. Education also predicts disbelief, supporting the “superficial knowledge” hypothesis. Measures of religiosity and spirituality had null effects, in contradiction of the “metaphysical uncertainty” hypothesis that a need for metaphysical beliefs causes one to believe in astrology. We find that right-wing individuals are less likely to believe in astrology, in contradiction to Theodore W. Adorno’s “authoritarian” of astrology. We also find no effect scientific trust on astrological belief. “

might be useful for others. If you want to set up a Hugo-based blog that creates
a nice static site and publishes without too much work, then this is one way to
do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few components:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Blogging Framework (how posts get created)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The UI&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automatic Publishing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automatic Deployment&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-blogging-framework">The Blogging Framework&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a class="link" href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hugo&lt;/a>. It allows me to write blog posts as
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Markdown&lt;/a> (in my &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>favorite
text editor&lt;/a>). Using that Markdown, it builds all of the
HTML in my chosen theme, along with all of the menu navigation, tagging, RSS
feeds, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s quite nice!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also keep everything in version control via &lt;a class="link" href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>git&lt;/a>. That
allows me to track changes over time. All of the files used to generate the site
are &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/briandailey/dailey.page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>on GitHub&lt;/a> which serves as
both a backup and a way to automate publishing and deployment (more about that below).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-ui">The UI&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hugo Theme Stack&lt;/a> by
Jimmy Cai. It looks nice, and I&amp;rsquo;m generally terrible at front-end design.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automated-publishing">Automated Publishing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you write content for Hugo, there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a class="link" href="https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>build
step&lt;/a> that you run to generate the site.
The simplest way to do this is to just run it locally and copy the resulting
files somewhere (like Cloudfront or Amazon S3). If you do this, you need to
remember the build command, any specific parameters for your build, etc. I got
into programming because I hate tedium, and that, my friend, is &lt;em>tedious&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spoiled by modern build systems where I need only push my changes to
the main branch on GitHub and the robots do the rest. So let&amp;rsquo;s do that!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used an &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hugo-gh-pages-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>existing action in the GitHub
Marketplace&lt;/a> and
forked it to &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/briandailey/actions-hugo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>my own repo&lt;/a> to make
a &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/briandailey/actions-hugo/commit/3246cff7d82dfba2cf8f8518948e794a72aba14f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>slight
modification&lt;/a>
in order to override which branch we&amp;rsquo;re pushing the published works to. In this
case, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use &lt;code>gh-pages&lt;/code> because I want to publish the static site
to Cloudflare using the &lt;code>static&lt;/code> branch.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automated-deployment">Automated Deployment&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cloudflare has a &lt;a class="link" href="https://mattsayar.com/why-does-cloudflare-pages-have-such-a-generous-free-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>very generous free
tier&lt;/a>
that makes it really easy to publish static content from GitHub to a domain.
Once you have an account, you&amp;rsquo;ll find it under &amp;ldquo;Compute (Workers)&amp;rdquo; and then
&amp;ldquo;Workers &amp;amp; Pages.&amp;rdquo; From there, you can create a Page and hook it up to a
specific GitHub repository and branch. In this case, I hooked it up to the
&lt;code>static&lt;/code> branch. Once you assign all of the permissions and get the custom
domain set up, Cloudflare takes care of the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrapping-it-all">Wrapping It All&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So that&amp;rsquo;s it! Now when I want to publish a new post, I edit the files locally,
commit the changes and push them to the main branch on GitHub. From there,
GitHub builds the files and publishes to another branch, where Cloudflare picks
it up to host on their free tier.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When I ended my time at Stratasan in March of 2023, my original goal was to stick to a lighter working schedule that allowed me to spend more time with my (rather large-ish) family. After committing over a decade to a startup, I was ready for a change of pace for a time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had two major goals in mind coming into 2024:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Make &amp;ldquo;small bets&amp;rdquo; on side projects that might gain traction (either on my own or with a business partner).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leverage my experience in the healthcare B2B SaaS (yes, it&amp;rsquo;s very specific) sector to earn income.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In 2024, my only &amp;ldquo;small bet&amp;rdquo; was Calendaristic. I spent more time in the first quarter of the year on this than any other quarter. As my consulting work (under &lt;a class="link" href="https://creollc.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Creo Advisory&lt;/a>) became more demanding, side projects became more difficult to focus on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What else happened in 2024, broadly speaking?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I co-founded the &lt;a class="link" href="https://nashvillectoclub.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Nashville CTO Club&lt;/a> with Josh Segall and Jim Siegienski.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I started &lt;a class="link" href="https://techfounder.community" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Tech Founder Community&lt;/a> to try to connect with other engineering founders and co-founders.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I connected with a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of people in 2024. I continue to believe that this is the primary way that serendipity strikes. According to Google Calendar, I met with over 400 people in 2024. Calendly was a life-saver here.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Many conversations started off with a meeting at some local event (Haley Zapolski and Josh Segall hosted many of these) or events at the Nashville Entrepreneur Center.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A good many of these were referrals from folks I have worked with or for in the past. Referrals are the best compliment I can receive!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-went-well">What went well?&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Nashville CTO Club got off to a &lt;em>great&lt;/em> start in September. Kudos to Mr. Segall for being the primary driver of this thing. It&amp;rsquo;s obvious that Josh hosts a lot of events, because he though of a lot of details that I simply would not have considered. It gave this group needed structure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The consulting / fractional business continued to do well. I was able to focus on clients that I felt I offerred the highest value (in my particular niche, relevant to my past experience) and turn down potential work for which I did not feel well-suited. A breakdown of how I billed categories is below. &amp;ldquo;P&amp;amp;E&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;Product and Engineering&amp;rdquo; - basically technical due diligence but for an organization instead of an investor.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I was able to (mostly) stick to a four-day-a-week work schedule, which allowed me to prioritize more time with my family.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>About halfway through the year I found myself doing a lot of interviewing for CTO and VPoE roles (I was the interviewer on behalf of my client). Given that this was somewhat of a rarity when I worked at one company, I used the opportunity to leverage the repitition here in order to improve my interview process. As Annie Dukes said, you can&amp;rsquo;t just gain experience by letting things wash over you; you have to be intentional about it! I feel like intentionally improving on my interviewing skills bore fruit.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>The Tech Founder Community languished. In June, it seemed like a doable thing. In July, baby #6 joined our family and I had forgotten just how much a new baby can take the wind out of your sails (especially in your forties!).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I spent so much time on Creo Advisory that I failed to get any other side projects off of the ground.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-my-goals-for-2025">What are my goals for 2025?&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I will launch three side projects into production in 2025. Two of these are known and in-progress. The third is a TBD.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I will block off more time for reading and writing. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to spend so much time on the application (consulting, building) that no time is spent learning and reflecting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;ll promote useful engagement within the Tech Founder Community, further refining it&amp;rsquo;s purpose and mission.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="other-thoughts">Other Thoughts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Presumably, I&amp;rsquo;m often hired as fractional CTO to help with the engineering team. But often I find that I spend more time with company leadership thinking about business strategy. Business strategy affects engineering strategy and vice versa. This is something that I enjoyed and would love to do more of. However, I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure if I want to market myself as some kind of strategic advisor!&lt;/p>

As my responsibilities increased, it became more and more important to manage my own time well. This included not only using my time effectively, but also prioritizing the right things to work on. As a manager, the bulk of my time was spent in meetings and one-on-ones, but those meetings often &lt;em>produced&lt;/em> a lot of work that needed focus time. Finding time for that focus was always challenging. In my role as an advisor at &lt;a class="link" href="https://creollc.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Creo Advisory&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed this is an extremely common challenge for engineering managers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A manager’s day is often split between many different calendar appointments (1:1s, syncs with senior leadership, etc) which makes it challenging to find any time for deep work. Much has been written about this elsewhere&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, starting with Paul Graham 2009 essay, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Maker&amp;rsquo;s Schedule, Manager&amp;rsquo;s Schedule&lt;/a>. Even beyond the non-coding kind of work that a manager needs to get done, there&amp;rsquo;s a strong argument to be made that engineering managers need to devote &lt;em>some&lt;/em> amount of time to, well, engineering.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many managers I speak to average about 30 hours a week or more in meetings. If you assume a 40 hour work week, that leaves 10 hours or less over a week to do everything else you need to do. Often, that 10 hours is randomly scattered across the week in 10-30 minute increments, which makes it &lt;em>extremely&lt;/em> challenging to find time to focus. As the heads-down work piles up, you become increasingly overwhelmed and important work may get dropped entirely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are three things that have helped alleviate this problem for me in the past.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Block off time for heads down work.&lt;/em> I strongly believe this is critical. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly difficult to concentrate on anything in short 30 minute bursts. Figure out what time of day works best for you and block off a minimum 2 hour chunk, if possible. For me, I was able to create a four hour block on Tuesday afternoons. Of course, sometimes things come up and you need to use that time for synchronous discussions, but it should be kept to a minimum.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Make sure that your manager and your team are aware of the problem and the need for focus.&lt;/em> There&amp;rsquo;s nothing more frustrating than attempting to allocate more time to heads-down work and having someone book over it for no good reason. Work with your team (both managers and your direct reports) to make sure they understand why you&amp;rsquo;re blocking time and what kinds of exceptions you have around booking over it. Use some of those management skills to sell the idea!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Find ways to signal to the team when you&amp;rsquo;re in focus time.&lt;/em> If you&amp;rsquo;re in an office, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to signal with various physical flags: wearing headphones, closing an office door (if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to have one), moving to a different physical location, etc. In a distributed environment, I have found it beneficial to signal &lt;a class="link" href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/11190973?hl=en&amp;amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>focus time&lt;/a> in group chat applications (e.g., Slack or Teams). You can often integrate your calendar with the group chat application to automatically change your status for you.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve sold your team on the idea and blocked off the time, it&amp;rsquo;s important to use that time wisely! &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Deep work&lt;/a> requires intentionality and effort, particularly when it comes to prioritization. Use it well. No pressure!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s no &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>silver bullet&lt;/a> here, but I believe that if you do these three things you will be a happier, more productive engineering manager.&lt;/p>

>why there aren&amp;rsquo;t more companies in the
Southeast started by
engineers&lt;/a>.
It prompted a lot of great conversations both online and offline. &lt;strong>The tl;dr: I&amp;rsquo;m
starting a group in Nashville for engineers-turned-entrepreneurs. You can sign
up or read more about the details at &lt;a class="link" href="https://techfounder.community" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>techfounder.community&lt;/a>.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-tech-founder-community">What is the Tech Founder Community?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Taken from &lt;a class="link" href="https://techfounder.community" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>the website&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The goal of this community is to encourage and enable engineers to leverage
their technical and domain expertise to build a thriving business. We do this
by connecting interested folks in local networks with peers, mentors, advisors,
and maybe even capital.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="nashville-already-has-a-lot-of-startup-type-groups-why-one-more">Nashville already has a lot of startup-type groups. Why one more?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The short version: existing support networks in Nashville do not target
engineering audiences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nashville does have a lot of great things going for it. Programs like the
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ec.co/programs/preflight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Nashville Entrepreneur Center Pre-Flight&lt;/a>
and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ec.co/programs/inflight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Inflight&lt;/a> programs are really great
ways to support growing businesses. However, this tends to support either
business development types (think MBA graduates) or domain experts. This tends
to lead to a lot of business founders looking for &amp;ldquo;technical co-founders&amp;rdquo;, often
in exchange for sweat equity&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s also a very active engineering community in Nashville. Many of them have
either launched their own business or have considered doing so. According to one
survey from Packt in 2018, &lt;a class="link" href="https://hub.packtpub.com/developers-want-to-become-entrepreneurs-make-successful-transition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>1 in 3 software developers hope to found their own
company&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The phenomenon of engineer-turned-entrepreneur is embraced in many coastal
cities, but this simply isn&amp;rsquo;t the case in middle America. I want to change that,
at least for Nashville, by providing a peer support network, veteran mentors,
and more. We can leverage existing infrastructure (like the EC) where
appropriate but focus on enabling and encouraging folks with a technical
background.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-makes-you-think-youre-qualified-to-host-this-group">What makes you think you&amp;rsquo;re qualified to host this group?&lt;/h2>

in 2022.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the &amp;ldquo;open concept&amp;rdquo; meetups. I was an active participant in
&lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCoffee_Club" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>OpenCoffee&lt;/a> circa 2008 (that&amp;rsquo;s
me in the center of a photo on &lt;a class="link" href="https://avc.com/2008/04/meetups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Fred Wilson&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a>).
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen how useful these informal groups can be in encouraging an ecosystem
of peer support.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I have experience managing communities. In fact, I met my wife on such a
community (that I started) back in the mid-90s (that&amp;rsquo;s some nerd-cred,
right?). When I moved from engineer to manager, I started a monthly breakfast
group for engineers-turned-managers ten years ago.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>The macroeconomic big picture.&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re in a weird time. The tech economy is struggling. Due to lay-offs,
a lot of engineers have some free time on their hands.
Some of them have fairly nice severance packages. What better time to dip your
toes into entrepreneurship?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>With all of the tech lay-offs, many of us are wondering how we can control
our own destiny. You&amp;rsquo;ve poured your heart into a company. The upside is
the company does well and you make someone else a lot of money. The
downside is you get unceremoniously cut when the economy lags (or
management makes poor decisions).&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> &amp;ldquo;Job stability&amp;rdquo; is not so
much, so you might as well roll the dice and potentially see some upside.&lt;/li>

>Economic slowdowns are the time to start a
company!&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>COVID19 made many re-evaluate what they&amp;rsquo;re doing.&lt;/strong> Some have chosen to
prioritize lifestyle changes (reduced working hours). Few companies are
willing to hire folks at less than 40 hours a week, so that narrows options
down to starting your own thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

2023&lt;/a> I started out doing some &lt;a class="link" href="http://localhost:1313/p/creo-advisory-llc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>advisory and technical due
diligence work&lt;/a> for investors.
I&amp;rsquo;m still doing advisory and diligence work, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also found demand for my
help as a fractional CTO.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="whats-a-fractional-cto">What&amp;rsquo;s a fractional CTO?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You might as well ask, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s a Chief Technology Officer (CTO)?&amp;rdquo; It varies a
lot from company to company (based on size, structure, and type of product) but
in general &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Wikipedia has a satisfactory
(although wordy)
answer&lt;/a>. If I had to
boil it down, I&amp;rsquo;d say that &amp;ldquo;the CTO makes sure that the technology strategy
aligns well with the business strategy and executes the technology strategy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fractional CTO does much of the same thing, but on a part-time (fractional)
basis, often working with more than one company at a time. Just like a full-time
CTO, a fractional CTO will often specialize in one industry or company stage of
growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my case, I work often with startups and early stage companies in the
healthcare sector. There are three things that make my career relevant to this
particular niche:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I have a amassed a wide range of experience in the healthcare sector across nearly a quarter century (I got my start in 2000).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I have spent most of my career in startups and early stage companies in New
York and Nashville, and have myself been a co-founder with a successful nine-figure exit.
I know excatly what it&amp;rsquo;s like to wear all of the hats, find product-market
fit, and scale a team!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Given my experience with technical due diligence (on both ends of the
transaction), I am familiar with the markers that investors are looking for
in a company.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The confluence of these three areas of experience have left me well suited to
serve as an advisor to the non-technical founders and leadership of startups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Technology strategy has a give-and-take relationship with business strategy
My job is to fully understand and internalize the business strategy, determine
technical feasibility, and then build a roadmap that combines the two.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-kinds-of-things-do-you-do-as-a-fractional-cto">What kinds of things do you do as a fractional CTO?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s all over the map (hence the title of this, &amp;ldquo;the wide world&amp;rdquo;!),
and that&amp;rsquo;s one of the things that I love about it. Here are some examples of
projects that I have done over the summer:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Diagnose the current reality (what we have) and identify gaps based on the
business strategy (what we need) and build a roadmap to get there. This has
ranged from early stage startups (the whole business runs in an Excel
spreadsheet!) to scaling growth companies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advise companies that are looking to hire their first full time engineer and
subsequent team members. This covers everything from sourcing leads,
interviewing, hiring, and then advising them while they ramp up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Perform a &amp;ldquo;pre-sale inspection&amp;rdquo; for early stage companies. In short, I
evaluate them as an investor might do in order to best prepare them for a
transaction.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I write more about the variety of things I do &lt;a class="link" href="https://creollc.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually, any engagement with a company lasts only 2-3 months. My goal is not to
embed myself in an organization forever: I&amp;rsquo;m there to help build a plan, get
things on track, and coach the team as needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-know-if-i-need-a-fractional-cto">How do I know if I need a fractional CTO?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are a few signs that it might be useful to bring on an fCTO:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Your primary product is a SaaS tool, but no one on the leadership team has technology
experience.&lt;/strong> A fractional CTO can work on your side of the table to make sure
that the technology roadmap supports the business strategy, that any
outsourced development work is not incurring unnecessary technology debt, and
to keep the momentum going.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Your development lead is highly technical, but not strategic.&lt;/strong> An fCTO can

from home at most once a week. In March of 2020, that all changed and we went
100% distributed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like many small companies in the before-times, we worked out of an office with
a small number of conference rooms. We used shared calendars to book the
rooms. If a meeting went over time, participants had to wrap up and
exit so the new meeting could get started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This served as a forcing function in a few ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The availability of meeting rooms put an artificial ceiling on the number of
meetings we could have at any time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meetings had to end on time so the room could be made available for the next
group.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recurring meetings were trickier to set up because one needed to check for room
availability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meetings were also &lt;em>visible&lt;/em>. You could see when folks were huddling (whether in
a conference room or at a desk).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m neutral on whether the above is good or bad. But it did serve to make
meetings more scarce, and scarcity increases value. If you have fewer meetings,
it forces you to be more intentional with how the time is spent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we left the office, all of that disappeared.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Meetings proliferated (anecdotally, but with some data to back it
up). In particular, &lt;em>recurring&lt;/em> meetings seemed to proliferate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meetings went over time more frequently. &amp;ldquo;Does anyone here have a hard stop?&amp;rdquo;
became a common question.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meetings seemed to carry a higher cognitive load on participants.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We did a lot to try to mitigate some of what we were seeing. Several of us
configured &amp;ldquo;speedy meetings&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. We performed periodic &amp;ldquo;recurring meeting
resets&amp;rdquo; where we cleared recurring meetings and only set up the ones we thought
were absolutely necessary. We encouraged detailed agendas. We set up a
&amp;ldquo;one-pager&amp;rdquo; that detailed &lt;em>how we do meetings&lt;/em> in order to try to make them more
efficient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think some of this worked. But I can&amp;rsquo;t be sure, because the data either didn&amp;rsquo;t
exist or was very tedious to gather. We could get some calendar statistics by doing spot checks.
I could look at my calendar as well as some of my team members. There is &lt;em>some&lt;/em>
calendar analytics built into the Google Workspace dashboard, but it was too
high level to really get any useful information from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I really wanted was a nice dashboard to monitor how we were doing. In
particular, I wanted to trend it over time. I had many questions. Among them:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Is our meeting burden (average per person) trending up or down?
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How high is &lt;em>too&lt;/em> high?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Break it down by recurring versus one-offs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How many meetings have an agenda? How many have a &lt;em>good&lt;/em> agenda?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Break down averages in a few ways:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>By department.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By internal vs. external participants.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since &amp;ldquo;speedy meetings&amp;rdquo; are only configurable on the account level, who are
the folks who are not taking advantage of that setting?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There are lots of other questions I want to answer, but these are the ones I
started with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of great calendar tools out there. But all of them, in my
experience, are targeted at the &lt;em>individual user&lt;/em>, not operators. I wanted a
tool that would look at my Google Workspace domain and run the analytics on
everyone in the company, not just me and/or my team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to find such a tool, I&amp;rsquo;m building it in
&lt;a class="link" href="https://calendaristic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Calendaristic&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

and early stage companies as an advisor as well as providing technical due
diligence to investors. My work is performed with &lt;a class="link" href="https://creollc.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Creo Advisory,
LLC&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="advisory-work">Advisory Work&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While at &lt;a class="link" href="https://dailey.page/p/hello-world" >Stratasan&lt;/a> I found myself doing a lot of things I
hadn&amp;rsquo;t done before (as one does when you grow a company from two to about
a hundred employees). Going from engineer to lead engineer to manager to manager
of managers meant that about every two years my job description changed
drastically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To keep up, I did an inordinate amount of reading. I also relied heavily on
discussions with peers. One thing that I found extremely useful was finding
trusted advisors to work with. They served as both experienced voices and
trusted soundboards. Often I had an idea of what I needed to do, I just needed
to walk through it with someone and have them tell me, &amp;ldquo;Yeah, that makes sense.
No, you&amp;rsquo;re not crazy.&amp;rdquo; Having an advisor not otherwise tied to the company would
also extract me from the day-to-day grind and help me see the larger strategy.
In short, I found having advisors to be very valuable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve also &lt;em>served&lt;/em> as an advisor to other companies. Given how engaged I was at
Stratasan, I could not do this as much as I would have liked. Post-exit, I have
more time to devote to this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One interesting thing about advisors is that the same advisor is not always
useful in every situation. Each time I found a good advisor, there was a process
of determining the subject matter expertise I needed most (product management?
security/compliance? engineering?) and reviewing potential candidates for
personality fit. I have worked with some folks who I was able to help for a time
and after a while they no longer needed what I could provide. Advisor
relationships are rarely permanent, and it&amp;rsquo;s important for the advisor and
advisee to know when it&amp;rsquo;s no longer worth the investment of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="technical-due-diligence">Technical Due Diligence&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been through a handful of technical due diligence processes. During each
one, I always thought about ways to make it easier on the prospective company.
They varied from &amp;ldquo;Wow, that felt entirely cursory&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Holy smokes, this goes
into a very unnecessary level of detail!&amp;rdquo; I hope to leverage this experience to
run a technical due diligence process that minimizes the time necessary from the prospective
company as well as maximizing usefulness for the investor or acquiring company.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-makes-_you_-qualified">What makes &lt;em>you&lt;/em> qualified?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a fair question! There are a couple attributes that make both an advisor or technical reviewer successful:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;em>A wide base of underlying experience.&lt;/em> I have worked in technology since
2000, giving me almost a quarter of a century of experience across a wide
array of startups across many technology stacks and industries.
Much of what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about successfully running
teams is applicable to pretty much any industry independent of the specific
technology stack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>A history as an operator.&lt;/em> Many consultants and advisors purport to have
some kind of system or process that will resolve all your business problems
(the proverbial &amp;ldquo;silver bullet&amp;rdquo;). Rarely do these folks have &lt;em>actual
experience operating a business.&lt;/em> The best advisors and investors that I&amp;rsquo;ve
worked with all had prior experience as an operator.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="ideal-project">Ideal project?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Given my experience, I&amp;rsquo;m better suited to working as an advisor or doing
technical diligence on startup and early stage companies with 5-100 employees.
My domain expertise is heavily in healthcare and my technical experience is
focused predominately on open-source stacks.&lt;/p>

>Roy Rapoport titled, &amp;ldquo;Being Right Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Matter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;ll probably butcher it by summarizing it in one line, so I suggest you go read it first (it&amp;rsquo;s only a few paragraphs). Ultimately, he makes the point that &amp;ldquo;being right doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you can&amp;rsquo;t build consensus.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wholeheartedly agree with this. As I was reading his post, I was reminded of a recent story that I heard on EconTalk&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> about a Hungarian physician and scientist, &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ignaz Semmelweis&lt;/a>. He noted that the doctors&amp;rsquo; ward had triple the mortality rate as the midwives&amp;rsquo; ward in his obstetric clinic. At the time, it was normal for doctors to carve up a cadaver in the morgue, wear the blood proudly on their apron (it was a badge to indicate just how hard they were working), and go straight to the labor and delivery rooms. Cleanliness was simply not a priority. Semmelweis noted that if he washed his hands in chlorinated lime solution the patient mortality rate dropped to 1%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He accumulated some evidence to back up his claims and published, hoping to save tens of thousands of lives. However, his claims were not well received. The wider medical field rejected Semmelweis&amp;rsquo;s claims and his impact was not as significant as he had hoped. Semmelwies died at 47 of blood poisoning in an insane asylum just a few years prior to his ideas becoming more widely accepted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of this reaction might be due to what Megan McArdle called the &amp;ldquo;Oedipus trap&amp;rdquo; (humans have a hard time reconciling the fact that their decisions may have caused a significant amount of harm, even if they were unintentional). It didn&amp;rsquo;t help that Semmelweis had a reputation of being a difficult guy to work with. He considered himself very smart and felt that his experimental studies should have been sufficient to convince others that he was right.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;hellip; Dr. Semmelwies also didn&amp;rsquo;t do himself any favors. [&amp;hellip;] He went out of his
way to attack doctors who rejected his thesis, devoting a full sixty-four
pages of one of his publications to attack a single obstetrician from Prague
who questioned his results.&lt;/em>&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This scenario is much more dramatic than anything we’d run into (we’re rarely contradicting the popular opinion of an entire profession) but if we agree that &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>group think&lt;/a> is bad, then we can agree that there are advantages for organizations to have a dissenting voice. It&amp;rsquo;s what Todd Kashdan delightfully calls &amp;ldquo;principled insubordination.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>With a single rebel airing alternate and unpopular views, a group reduces its
confirmation bias and motivated reasoning and increases its creative
output.&lt;/em>&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In Kashdan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Art of Insubordination,&amp;rdquo; he spends the first few chapters
presenting all of the evidence that &lt;em>we need skeptics.&lt;/em> This is especially true in any organization where
the work involves both creativity and complexity. Creative and complex endeavors (which applies to most product-first organizations)
benefit from people who are willing to speak up in situations where they may be contradicting popular opinion (&amp;ldquo;group think&amp;rdquo;).
Skeptical viewpoints can encourage more thoughtful discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the issue is that many organizations do not &lt;em>encourage&lt;/em> skepticism. On
the contrary, they often suppress it. If you&amp;rsquo;ve seen a leader respond
defensively to a question asked in good faith, then you&amp;rsquo;ve seen this happen.
&lt;a class="link" href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/how-to-make-meetings-less-terrible-ep-389/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Unhealthy peace&lt;/a>
is often prioritized over healthy conflict. Furthermore, it only takes is one
poor reaction to a challenging question to effectively silence all future questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This leads to an environment where only the boldest or most adversarial team
members will express skepticism. In short: &lt;em>if an environment is hostile to
dissenting opinions, then the only dissenting opinions will be hostile.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ergo, we need to build environments where contrary opinions are welcomed and
rewarded so that we can benefit from sharper critical thinking from our teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What can you as a manager or leader do to encourage principled insubordination?
Here are four specific things.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>First, be vulnerable. This take courage and is often uncomfortable. Brene Brown really does a great job of explaining this in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40109367-dare-to-lead" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dare To Lead&lt;/a>. Leadership must demonstrate that they can’t know all of the things and that they are open to changing course. If leadership is not open to criticism, they will receive none, and the organization will be worse for it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coach. There’s a fine line between being a skeptic (challenging commonly accepted opinions, good) and a cynic (believing that others are not acting in good faith, bad). A cynical person might be recovering from a previous job where they were not able to ask (or, worse, punished for asking) critical questions, but with the right encouragement they might be converted into a skeptic. Other team members might just need a little help challenging opinions in a diplomatic, constructive way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Solicit. Solicitation of feedback is often required because many people are reluctant to provide honest feedback because they&amp;rsquo;ve learned that leaders don’t react well. Keeping your head down is a good strategy in many organizations, so you have to work to solicit dissenting opinions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reward. Even solicitation may not be effective if some team members have had poor experiences raising objections in the past. Hence, rewarding those that speak up is critical as it signals to everyone else that disagreement is encouraged. Asking for clarification, seeking to understand, answering questions in good faith and, most importantly, changing course when merited: all of this indicates to the team that managers and leaders are open to constructive feedback.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This short list might make it sound easy, but as any leader would know, it is most certainly not. A rush of adrenaline is a fundamental human reaction to contradiction, propelling us toward a vigorous verbal defense. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tamp that immediate reaction down and listen. Listening can take the form of asking clarifying questions, surfacing the underlying problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once those voices have been heard and addressed in good faith, then the team can move on, even if it means that some parties have to &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>disagree and commit&lt;/a>. By being vulnerable, coaching, soliciting opinions, and rewarding dissent organizations can continue to benefit from critical thinking and avoid the trap of artificial consensus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(You might be saying, &amp;ldquo;Alright, that&amp;rsquo;s all well and good, Brian, what if I&amp;rsquo;m not a manager? What if I am the skeptic?&amp;rdquo; Well, carry on, I say! If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for ways to be more effective, then I recommend checking out &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57559387-the-art-of-insubordination" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

thought it would be useful to share some of the books that were influential to
me as I went from engineer to a lead-of-leads.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="code-completehttpswwwgoodreadscombookshow4845code_complete-by-steve-mcconnell">&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4845.Code_Complete" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>This book probably feels a bit dated as it was published in 2004. However, I
found this very useful early in my engineering career as I was learning to build
systems that were maintainable and useful. Some of the maxims that McConnell
included in this book are true no matter the language. For example, &amp;ldquo;write
programs for people first, computers second.&amp;rdquo; I often had a tendency to get
clever with code rather than trying to be blindingly obvious; being clever
tended to produce more pain (both for myself and others) down the road.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This book makes &amp;ldquo;Code Complete&amp;rdquo; feel quite young as &amp;ldquo;Mythical&amp;rdquo; was written in 1975. However, it&amp;rsquo;s commentary on software development is still timeless (if one can overlook some of the underlying sexism prevalent at the time). Two essays stuck with me more than others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s No Silver Bullet&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> highlighted accidental complexity versus essential complexity. Much work has been done to address accidental complexity (especially since 1975!) but essential complexity, the complexity of the underlying problems that we&amp;rsquo;re trying to solve, will always be with us. This one stuck with me because non-engineering types are &lt;em>constantly&lt;/em> enamoured by &amp;ldquo;silver bullets&amp;rdquo; - whether it&amp;rsquo;s data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or whatever is coming next. Whenever they come upon a hard problem they ask, &amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t we just use [the silver bullet]?&amp;rdquo; Even engineers like myself can fall prey to this way of thinking. The trouble is that these bullets rarely address &lt;em>the complexity of the underlying problem space&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

>&amp;ldquo;The Mythical Man Month&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> Brooks asserts that &amp;ldquo;adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.&amp;rdquo; He highlights the importance of team communication in complex projects and provides a formula to demonstrate that more people means more and more communication overhead. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this described by someone else as &amp;ldquo;clinks versus drinks.&amp;rdquo; If you sit at a bar with three people, you clink three times and then you can drink. But as you add more and more people to the party, all of your time is spent clinking with very little time for drinking!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ron Jeffries is one of the original signatories of the &lt;a class="link" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>agile
manifesto&lt;/a>. The manifesto has been pillaged and
plundered by consultants until it has become &lt;a class="link" href="https://scaledagileframework.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

unrecognizable&lt;/a> from the original intent.
This book brings it all back home. We&amp;rsquo;re just here to deliver value to our
customers!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Stratasan and product and engineering teams read this as a group at least
twice. I found it to be extremely useful to help everyone get on the same page
about how a product-first company delivers value to customers. It helped us use
similar vocabulary (&amp;ldquo;tall and skinnies!&amp;rdquo; meaning high value, low cost). This
book was particularly useful because it explains the &lt;em>process&lt;/em> of software
development so well that you don&amp;rsquo;t actually need to be a developer to understand
it. That makes it much more useful for development-adjacent roles like product
management, QA, etc.&lt;/p>

>Inspired&lt;/a> by Marty Cagan and Chris Jones&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Speaking of product management, this book and &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55954021-empowered" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Empowered&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;
are aimed more at product managers. The Stratasan team read both of these books
as a group and I found them to be extremely helpful to communicate the vision
for a true product-first company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If &amp;ldquo;The Nature of Software Development&amp;rdquo; was a good introduction to software
development for product managers, &amp;ldquo;Inspired&amp;rdquo; was a great introduction to product
management for software developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="acceleratehttpswwwgoodreadscombookshow35747076-accelerate-by-forsgren-humble-and-kim">&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35747076-accelerate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Accelerate&lt;/a> by Forsgren, Humble, and Kim&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of my biggest gripes with most &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; books is that they rarely have
data to back them up. Instead, they tend to rely on overly cute anecdotes to
emphasize or validate their assertions. &amp;ldquo;Accelerate&amp;rdquo; does not make this mistake.
You might be able to point out issues with their data collection (that&amp;rsquo;s beyond
my pay grade) but they certainly have the data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This book highlights the engineering metrics that correlate best with successful
organizations, based on annual surveys performed by the authors. They boil it
down to four key metrics. I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of metrics for the sake of metrics, but
they make a very good case that these four metrics are really the ones you want
to watch.&lt;/p>

>The Manager&amp;rsquo;s Path&lt;/a> by Camille Fournier&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This book is broken out in a way that matches the trajectory of most careers in engineering management: from
individual contributor, to team lead, to manager of a single team, to multiple
teams, and then finally a manager of managers. This was a book I constantly kept
on hand as our company grew and I found myself referencing it often.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="high-output-managementhttpswwwgoodreadscomisbookshow324750high_output_management-by-andrew-grove">&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/is/book/show/324750.High_Output_Management" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>High Output Management&lt;/a> by Andrew Grove&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I found the title of this book off-putting at first. Some of the anecdotes and
recommendations are a bit heavy on the manufacturing side (not necessarily
suitable advice for the creative endeavor of a product company). However, it&amp;rsquo;s
good advice outweighed the anachronisms. It helped me understand a lot of the
reasoning behind OKRs. The single thing I took from this book: as a manager,
you&amp;rsquo;re no longer responsible for &lt;em>your&lt;/em> work; you&amp;rsquo;re now responsible for your
team&amp;rsquo;s work. Your job is now to help your team grow. I found this helpful as I
was transitioning from an individual contributor, because I still was very
tempted to measure my success based on &lt;em>my&lt;/em> output, not my teams. Trying to
balance individual output and managing a team is a miserable existence: this
book got me out of that hole.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tractionhttpswwwgoodreadscombookshow18886376-traction-by-gino-wickman">&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18886376-traction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Traction&lt;/a> by Gino Wickman&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This book might feel like the odd-one out in this anthology, but I include it
because it had a &lt;em>huge&lt;/em> influence on how we ran the day-to-day business at Stratasan.
Neither Jason Moore (CEO) nor myself had ever scaled a company to a hundred
people. This book and EOS helped us to set up a good cadence of meetings and
communication between the various teams. It allowed us to set the strategy,
execute on it, and bubble up issues more quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We eventually moved away from stick adherence to EOS, but it served us well as
a solid foundation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-about-you">What about you?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These are the books that I found to be most helpful during Stratasan&amp;rsquo;s growth.

>dailytechnology.net&lt;/a> and will keep the
old Jekyll-based blog around just for historical purposes.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2022, I ended a long tenure working for Stratasan, the company that I
co-founded with Jason Moore back in 2011. It has been a huge part of my career
and I doubt I will ever get to experience anything like it again.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I say that not because it was a successful company but because of the kinds of
people I got to work with. Ten years from now, I won&amp;rsquo;t remember much about the
business strategy, the technical architecture, the effort we put into solid
ecurity patterns, or the roadmap priorities. What I&amp;rsquo;ll remember is the people,
and how it felt to work with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stratasan was special because our engineering and product
teams had a very high level of trust. If you have spent much time with Jason Moore, you
would learn that he is a special kind of leader. A lot of leaders like you to
think they know absolutely everything. Leaders must project confidence, yes, but
they also need to acknowledge that they can&amp;rsquo;t know &lt;em>everything&lt;/em>, and Jason Moore
walked that balance very well. Since leaders set the tone for the rest of the
company, this vulnerability cascaded down to new hires and became part of our culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I learned a lot at Stratasan. Every year or so my job description completely
changed. There are some things that I would have done differently. As an
engineer, I was used to fast feedback: if you do something silly, hopefully you
have some unit tests that fail and you go fix it. Management is completely
different. When you do something stupid, sometimes you don&amp;rsquo;t know just how
stupid it was for weeks or even months. When I did make a mistake, I tried to
learn from it.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s next for me? I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure. At this time, I have many personal
things that require my attention, so I am taking a pause to reassess my
priorities and decide what I want to spend my time on next. One thing I do know
that I&amp;rsquo;d like to do again is write, so that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve set this up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See you next time!&lt;/p>
