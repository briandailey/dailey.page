&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Whenever you find yourself saying something for a second time (to a second
audience or in a second situation), it is highly likely that you will send up
saying it again and again in the future. To vastly improve the quality of the
communication and reduce the amount of time that you spend communicating the
information, &lt;em>write it down&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;mdash; Matt Mochary in &amp;ldquo;The Great CEO Within&amp;rdquo;, p. 22&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing the &lt;a class="link" href="https://dailey.page/p/wide-world-of-the-fractional-cto/" >fractional CTO (fCTO)
thing&lt;/a> for about &lt;a class="link" href="https://dailey.page/p/2024-in-retro/" >two
years&lt;/a> now, and I
get quite a few people who ask me about how I got things started. Given the
&lt;a class="link" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>rapid reduction in available software development-related
positions&lt;/a>, it makes
sense that there are quite a few who are considering &lt;a class="link" href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/hang&amp;#43;out&amp;#43;shingle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>hanging out a
shingle&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoy discussing this with folks, but my policy on these things is that if I
find myself repeating the same material, I should probably save myself and
everyone else a lot of time by just writing it down! This is my attempt to do
that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Much of this advice on getting started is really applicable to anyone doing any
kind of consulting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-should-i-get-started">How should I get started?&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="have-the-experience">Have the experience.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t have data on this, but I get the sense that the demand for fractional
leadership has gone up since 2022. Supply has risen to meet that demand.
However, a fair portion of the supply (of fractional leaders) has never actually been in a leadership
position. When I ask clients why they choose to work with me, many of them
have pointed at my experience as both a founder and a leader. A
departmental manager at BigCorp might carve out a reputation as a team leader,
but someone with very little (or no) prior leadership experience might find it
difficult to find a toehold in a crowded market.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="find-a-niche">Find a niche.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One common issue I see with folks getting started is that they make no
real attempts at defining where they can truly add value. I get that it&amp;rsquo;s
tempting to do All The Things when you first get started - after all, you need
to get paid and eat! If you specify a niche (industry, stage of
company, B2B or B2C, SaaS or otherwise, or some combination of these things)
you can start to figure out who you should be marketing and talking to. Speaking
of talking&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="talk-to-a-lot-of-people">Talk to a lot of people.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I get it, sales is hard (especially if you are an introverted engineer-type like
me), but if you&amp;rsquo;re going solo then you&amp;rsquo;re also the salesperson.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The easiest way to figure out how many conversations you need to have is to
take some notes from the SaaS sales playbook. First, figure out what your annual
revenue target is. Next, determine what your average fractional engagement will
net you. (If you&amp;rsquo;re just getting started, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be fuzzy math, but
that&amp;rsquo;s ok! You can adjust this as you get more information.) Keep all of your
opportunities in a CRM (HubSpot&amp;rsquo;s free tier is pretty good for a solo operation)
and use that information to determine what ratio of conversations you have to
close an engagement. Your sample size may be rather small, but again, fuzzy math
is okay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For myself, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that I need to have maybe 2-3 conversations a week with
various folks in my industry. Those are not sales conversations, and they
are very unlikely to end in an engagement. But if I&amp;rsquo;m having conversations with
the right people, each meeting is a person who might know someone else needing
my help. They could be a source for a warm lead.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="have-some-sample-proposals-and-deliverables-ready">Have some sample proposals (and deliverables) ready.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have found it to be useful to have several different sample proposals on hand.
It provides potential clients with an idea of how I approach engagements (clear
terms, flat rates, etc) and makes them more comfortable with the idea of working
with me.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="start-with-projects-before-going-open-ended">Start with projects before going open-ended.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For me, fCTO engagements are completely open-ended. I&amp;rsquo;m only taking on two
clients at a time, and generally they are a day or two (sometimes more) per week
in, for which I am billing a weekly rate. However, that&amp;rsquo;s a lot to sign on for
if you&amp;rsquo;ve not worked with me before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To establish trust, I&amp;rsquo;ll often start a relationship with a well-defined project.
Having a well-scoped project with a discrete (written) deliverable familiarizes
clients with my working style (and me with theirs).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="keep-the-pipeline-going">Keep the pipeline going.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you pick up one or two projects, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get so involved in them that
you forget to keep talking to folks about potential future projects. When you
finish the project, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be in a mad scramble to find your next
engagement.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-do-_not_-you-like-about-being-a-fractional-cto">What do &lt;em>not&lt;/em> you like about being a Fractional CTO?&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="you-do-all-the-things">You do all the things.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Sales. Marketing. Accounting. Bill collection. As a solo practioner, you do &lt;em>all
the things&lt;/em>. That eats into the time that you&amp;rsquo;ll spend doing the thing you love,
but it&amp;rsquo;s part of the deal!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="staying-fresh-requires-intentionality">Staying fresh requires intentionality.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll no doubt learn new things just engaging with clients, but to stay on top
of industry trends (both technology and whatever domain you&amp;rsquo;re working in) you
will have to allocate some time to ongoing self-education. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to skip
this part, but don&amp;rsquo;t! Your continued usefulness &lt;em>depends&lt;/em> on staying current.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="you-trade-depth-for-breadth">You trade depth for breadth.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you&amp;rsquo;re consulting, you rarely get to spend enough time with one
project (maybe 3-6 months for most of my engagements) to go really deep. Instead, you
get exposed to a broad array of industry niches, architectures, languages, and
product categories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a trade-off here. I enjoyed going deep for 13 years (from first line of
code to exit) with Stratasan. I also enjoy the variety inherent to consulting.
Ideally, one could switch between depth and breadth every 5-7 years.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="there-will-be-juggling">There will be juggling.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I take on no more than two fractional engagements at any time due to this. I
also stress to potential clients that it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>fractional&lt;/em>, not &lt;em>interim.&lt;/em> This
means I am not always immediately available, but I do clearly communicate
my availability with all clients via Calendly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-do-you-love-about-fractional-leadership">What do you love about fractional leadership?&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="i-love-strategy">I love strategy.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a fractional chief &lt;em>technology&lt;/em> officer, I would presumably be working on
engineering strategy. However, I find that when I start asking questions I often
start edging into &lt;em>business strategy&lt;/em>, which I love. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing more
satisfying to me than a client asking me to sit in on one of their annual or
quarterly strategic planning sessions!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-love-the-autonomy">I love the autonomy.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I get to choose the clients I work with, and I&amp;rsquo;m fairly picky about it. I only
want to work with companies that I feel I can provide an unusual level of value
(e.g., sticking to my niche of early-ish stage healthcare B2B SaaS). That makes
the work both more satisfying to me and more valuable to my clients.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-love-the-security">I love the security.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Assuming you are able to keep the pipeline going, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more security in
having six or seven ongoing clients (between fractional CTO, advisory, and
project work) rather than putting all your eggs in one basket for a single
company.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-love-the-variety">I love the variety.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I get bored fairly easily, so I love it when I can hit several interesting
engagements in a single year. They will probably be in healthcare, but they
could otherwise be completely unlike (different technology stacks, different
business problems, different company cultures and problems they are facing). I
thrive on this variety.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="parting-thoughts">Parting Thoughts&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you have an appetite for it, I believe fractional leadership can be very
fulfilling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about striking out as an fCTO, there are a lot of resources
already out there to get you going. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to learn everything from
scratch!&lt;/p>

might be useful for others. If you want to set up a Hugo-based blog that creates
a nice static site and publishes without too much work, then this is one way to
do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few components:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Blogging Framework (how posts get created)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The UI&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automatic Publishing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automatic Deployment&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-blogging-framework">The Blogging Framework&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a class="link" href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hugo&lt;/a>. It allows me to write blog posts as
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Markdown&lt;/a> (in my &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>favorite
text editor&lt;/a>). Using that Markdown, it builds all of the
HTML in my chosen theme, along with all of the menu navigation, tagging, RSS
feeds, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s quite nice!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also keep everything in version control via &lt;a class="link" href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>git&lt;/a>. That
allows me to track changes over time. All of the files used to generate the site
are &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/briandailey/dailey.page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>on GitHub&lt;/a> which serves as
both a backup and a way to automate publishing and deployment (more about that below).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-ui">The UI&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hugo Theme Stack&lt;/a> by
Jimmy Cai. It looks nice, and I&amp;rsquo;m generally terrible at front-end design.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automated-publishing">Automated Publishing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you write content for Hugo, there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a class="link" href="https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>build
step&lt;/a> that you run to generate the site.
The simplest way to do this is to just run it locally and copy the resulting
files somewhere (like Cloudfront or Amazon S3). If you do this, you need to
remember the build command, any specific parameters for your build, etc. I got
into programming because I hate tedium, and that, my friend, is &lt;em>tedious&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spoiled by modern build systems where I need only push my changes to
the main branch on GitHub and the robots do the rest. So let&amp;rsquo;s do that!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used an &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hugo-gh-pages-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>existing action in the GitHub
Marketplace&lt;/a> and
forked it to &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/briandailey/actions-hugo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>my own repo&lt;/a> to make
a &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/briandailey/actions-hugo/commit/3246cff7d82dfba2cf8f8518948e794a72aba14f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>slight
modification&lt;/a>
in order to override which branch we&amp;rsquo;re pushing the published works to. In this
case, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use &lt;code>gh-pages&lt;/code> because I want to publish the static site
to Cloudflare using the &lt;code>static&lt;/code> branch.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automated-deployment">Automated Deployment&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cloudflare has a &lt;a class="link" href="https://mattsayar.com/why-does-cloudflare-pages-have-such-a-generous-free-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>very generous free
tier&lt;/a>
that makes it really easy to publish static content from GitHub to a domain.
Once you have an account, you&amp;rsquo;ll find it under &amp;ldquo;Compute (Workers)&amp;rdquo; and then
&amp;ldquo;Workers &amp;amp; Pages.&amp;rdquo; From there, you can create a Page and hook it up to a
specific GitHub repository and branch. In this case, I hooked it up to the
&lt;code>static&lt;/code> branch. Once you assign all of the permissions and get the custom
domain set up, Cloudflare takes care of the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrapping-it-all">Wrapping It All&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So that&amp;rsquo;s it! Now when I want to publish a new post, I edit the files locally,
commit the changes and push them to the main branch on GitHub. From there,
GitHub builds the files and publishes to another branch, where Cloudflare picks
it up to host on their free tier.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bonus-automated-rss-ingestion-for-weekly-posts">Bonus: Automated RSS Ingestion for &amp;ldquo;Weekly Posts&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Inspired by the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class="link" href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/02/friday-assorted-links-508.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>assorted links&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;
on Marginal Revolution and the &amp;ldquo;Highlights&amp;rdquo; on &lt;a class="link" href="https://simonwillison.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Simon Willison&amp;rsquo;s
blog&lt;/a>, I wanted to aggregate interesting things I
found during the week into a single post. To do this, I wrote a really &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/briandailey/weeklylink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>terrible
little script&lt;/a> to accumulate links
that I post to &lt;a class="link" href="https://pinboard.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Pinboard&lt;/a> with the &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; tag. You
can see what the first post created in this manner

from home at most once a week. In March of 2020, that all changed and we went
100% distributed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like many small companies in the before-times, we worked out of an office with
a small number of conference rooms. We used shared calendars to book the
rooms. If a meeting went over time, participants had to wrap up and
exit so the new meeting could get started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This served as a forcing function in a few ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The availability of meeting rooms put an artificial ceiling on the number of
meetings we could have at any time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meetings had to end on time so the room could be made available for the next
group.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recurring meetings were trickier to set up because one needed to check for room
availability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meetings were also &lt;em>visible&lt;/em>. You could see when folks were huddling (whether in
a conference room or at a desk).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m neutral on whether the above is good or bad. But it did serve to make
meetings more scarce, and scarcity increases value. If you have fewer meetings,
it forces you to be more intentional with how the time is spent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we left the office, all of that disappeared.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Meetings proliferated (anecdotally, but with some data to back it
up). In particular, &lt;em>recurring&lt;/em> meetings seemed to proliferate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meetings went over time more frequently. &amp;ldquo;Does anyone here have a hard stop?&amp;rdquo;
became a common question.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meetings seemed to carry a higher cognitive load on participants.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We did a lot to try to mitigate some of what we were seeing. Several of us
configured &amp;ldquo;speedy meetings&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. We performed periodic &amp;ldquo;recurring meeting
resets&amp;rdquo; where we cleared recurring meetings and only set up the ones we thought
were absolutely necessary. We encouraged detailed agendas. We set up a
&amp;ldquo;one-pager&amp;rdquo; that detailed &lt;em>how we do meetings&lt;/em> in order to try to make them more
efficient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think some of this worked. But I can&amp;rsquo;t be sure, because the data either didn&amp;rsquo;t
exist or was very tedious to gather. We could get some calendar statistics by doing spot checks.
I could look at my calendar as well as some of my team members. There is &lt;em>some&lt;/em>
calendar analytics built into the Google Workspace dashboard, but it was too
high level to really get any useful information from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I really wanted was a nice dashboard to monitor how we were doing. In
particular, I wanted to trend it over time. I had many questions. Among them:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Is our meeting burden (average per person) trending up or down?
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How high is &lt;em>too&lt;/em> high?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Break it down by recurring versus one-offs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How many meetings have an agenda? How many have a &lt;em>good&lt;/em> agenda?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Break down averages in a few ways:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>By department.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By internal vs. external participants.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since &amp;ldquo;speedy meetings&amp;rdquo; are only configurable on the account level, who are
the folks who are not taking advantage of that setting?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There are lots of other questions I want to answer, but these are the ones I
started with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of great calendar tools out there. But all of them, in my
experience, are targeted at the &lt;em>individual user&lt;/em>, not operators. I wanted a
tool that would look at my Google Workspace domain and run the analytics on
everyone in the company, not just me and/or my team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to find such a tool, I&amp;rsquo;m building it in
&lt;a class="link" href="https://calendaristic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Calendaristic&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am looking for a handful of companies that can test this with me as it&amp;rsquo;s being
developed. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, please head over to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://calendaristic.com/signup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>sign up

>Roy Rapoport titled, &amp;ldquo;Being Right Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Matter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;ll probably butcher it by summarizing it in one line, so I suggest you go read it first (it&amp;rsquo;s only a few paragraphs). Ultimately, he makes the point that &amp;ldquo;being right doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you can&amp;rsquo;t build consensus.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wholeheartedly agree with this. As I was reading his post, I was reminded of a recent story that I heard on EconTalk&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> about a Hungarian physician and scientist, &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ignaz Semmelweis&lt;/a>. He noted that the doctors&amp;rsquo; ward had triple the mortality rate as the midwives&amp;rsquo; ward in his obstetric clinic. At the time, it was normal for doctors to carve up a cadaver in the morgue, wear the blood proudly on their apron (it was a badge to indicate just how hard they were working), and go straight to the labor and delivery rooms. Cleanliness was simply not a priority. Semmelweis noted that if he washed his hands in chlorinated lime solution the patient mortality rate dropped to 1%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He accumulated some evidence to back up his claims and published, hoping to save tens of thousands of lives. However, his claims were not well received. The wider medical field rejected Semmelweis&amp;rsquo;s claims and his impact was not as significant as he had hoped. Semmelwies died at 47 of blood poisoning in an insane asylum just a few years prior to his ideas becoming more widely accepted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of this reaction might be due to what Megan McArdle called the &amp;ldquo;Oedipus trap&amp;rdquo; (humans have a hard time reconciling the fact that their decisions may have caused a significant amount of harm, even if they were unintentional). It didn&amp;rsquo;t help that Semmelweis had a reputation of being a difficult guy to work with. He considered himself very smart and felt that his experimental studies should have been sufficient to convince others that he was right.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;hellip; Dr. Semmelwies also didn&amp;rsquo;t do himself any favors. [&amp;hellip;] He went out of his
way to attack doctors who rejected his thesis, devoting a full sixty-four
pages of one of his publications to attack a single obstetrician from Prague
who questioned his results.&lt;/em>&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This scenario is much more dramatic than anything we’d run into (we’re rarely contradicting the popular opinion of an entire profession) but if we agree that &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>group think&lt;/a> is bad, then we can agree that there are advantages for organizations to have a dissenting voice. It&amp;rsquo;s what Todd Kashdan delightfully calls &amp;ldquo;principled insubordination.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>With a single rebel airing alternate and unpopular views, a group reduces its
confirmation bias and motivated reasoning and increases its creative
output.&lt;/em>&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In Kashdan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Art of Insubordination,&amp;rdquo; he spends the first few chapters
presenting all of the evidence that &lt;em>we need skeptics.&lt;/em> This is especially true in any organization where
the work involves both creativity and complexity. Creative and complex endeavors (which applies to most product-first organizations)
benefit from people who are willing to speak up in situations where they may be contradicting popular opinion (&amp;ldquo;group think&amp;rdquo;).
Skeptical viewpoints can encourage more thoughtful discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the issue is that many organizations do not &lt;em>encourage&lt;/em> skepticism. On
the contrary, they often suppress it. If you&amp;rsquo;ve seen a leader respond
defensively to a question asked in good faith, then you&amp;rsquo;ve seen this happen.
&lt;a class="link" href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/how-to-make-meetings-less-terrible-ep-389/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Unhealthy peace&lt;/a>
is often prioritized over healthy conflict. Furthermore, it only takes is one
poor reaction to a challenging question to effectively silence all future questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This leads to an environment where only the boldest or most adversarial team
members will express skepticism. In short: &lt;em>if an environment is hostile to
dissenting opinions, then the only dissenting opinions will be hostile.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ergo, we need to build environments where contrary opinions are welcomed and
rewarded so that we can benefit from sharper critical thinking from our teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What can you as a manager or leader do to encourage principled insubordination?
Here are four specific things.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>First, be vulnerable. This take courage and is often uncomfortable. Brene Brown really does a great job of explaining this in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40109367-dare-to-lead" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dare To Lead&lt;/a>. Leadership must demonstrate that they can’t know all of the things and that they are open to changing course. If leadership is not open to criticism, they will receive none, and the organization will be worse for it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coach. There’s a fine line between being a skeptic (challenging commonly accepted opinions, good) and a cynic (believing that others are not acting in good faith, bad). A cynical person might be recovering from a previous job where they were not able to ask (or, worse, punished for asking) critical questions, but with the right encouragement they might be converted into a skeptic. Other team members might just need a little help challenging opinions in a diplomatic, constructive way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Solicit. Solicitation of feedback is often required because many people are reluctant to provide honest feedback because they&amp;rsquo;ve learned that leaders don’t react well. Keeping your head down is a good strategy in many organizations, so you have to work to solicit dissenting opinions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reward. Even solicitation may not be effective if some team members have had poor experiences raising objections in the past. Hence, rewarding those that speak up is critical as it signals to everyone else that disagreement is encouraged. Asking for clarification, seeking to understand, answering questions in good faith and, most importantly, changing course when merited: all of this indicates to the team that managers and leaders are open to constructive feedback.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This short list might make it sound easy, but as any leader would know, it is most certainly not. A rush of adrenaline is a fundamental human reaction to contradiction, propelling us toward a vigorous verbal defense. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tamp that immediate reaction down and listen. Listening can take the form of asking clarifying questions, surfacing the underlying problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once those voices have been heard and addressed in good faith, then the team can move on, even if it means that some parties have to &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>disagree and commit&lt;/a>. By being vulnerable, coaching, soliciting opinions, and rewarding dissent organizations can continue to benefit from critical thinking and avoid the trap of artificial consensus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(You might be saying, &amp;ldquo;Alright, that&amp;rsquo;s all well and good, Brian, what if I&amp;rsquo;m not a manager? What if I am the skeptic?&amp;rdquo; Well, carry on, I say! If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for ways to be more effective, then I recommend checking out &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57559387-the-art-of-insubordination" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

thought it would be useful to share some of the books that were influential to
me as I went from engineer to a lead-of-leads.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="code-completehttpswwwgoodreadscombookshow4845code_complete-by-steve-mcconnell">&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4845.Code_Complete" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>This book probably feels a bit dated as it was published in 2004. However, I
found this very useful early in my engineering career as I was learning to build
systems that were maintainable and useful. Some of the maxims that McConnell
included in this book are true no matter the language. For example, &amp;ldquo;write
programs for people first, computers second.&amp;rdquo; I often had a tendency to get
clever with code rather than trying to be blindingly obvious; being clever
tended to produce more pain (both for myself and others) down the road.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This book makes &amp;ldquo;Code Complete&amp;rdquo; feel quite young as &amp;ldquo;Mythical&amp;rdquo; was written in 1975. However, it&amp;rsquo;s commentary on software development is still timeless (if one can overlook some of the underlying sexism prevalent at the time). Two essays stuck with me more than others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s No Silver Bullet&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> highlighted accidental complexity versus essential complexity. Much work has been done to address accidental complexity (especially since 1975!) but essential complexity, the complexity of the underlying problems that we&amp;rsquo;re trying to solve, will always be with us. This one stuck with me because non-engineering types are &lt;em>constantly&lt;/em> enamoured by &amp;ldquo;silver bullets&amp;rdquo; - whether it&amp;rsquo;s data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or whatever is coming next. Whenever they come upon a hard problem they ask, &amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t we just use [the silver bullet]?&amp;rdquo; Even engineers like myself can fall prey to this way of thinking. The trouble is that these bullets rarely address &lt;em>the complexity of the underlying problem space&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month#The_mythical_man-month" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&amp;ldquo;The Mythical Man Month&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> Brooks asserts that &amp;ldquo;adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.&amp;rdquo; He highlights the importance of team communication in complex projects and provides a formula to demonstrate that more people means more and more communication overhead. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this described by someone else as &amp;ldquo;clinks versus drinks.&amp;rdquo; If you sit at a bar with three people, you clink three times and then you can drink. But as you add more and more people to the party, all of your time is spent clinking with very little time for drinking!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ron Jeffries is one of the original signatories of the &lt;a class="link" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>agile
manifesto&lt;/a>. The manifesto has been pillaged and
plundered by consultants until it has become &lt;a class="link" href="https://scaledagileframework.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

unrecognizable&lt;/a> from the original intent.
This book brings it all back home. We&amp;rsquo;re just here to deliver value to our
customers!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Stratasan and product and engineering teams read this as a group at least
twice. I found it to be extremely useful to help everyone get on the same page
about how a product-first company delivers value to customers. It helped us use
similar vocabulary (&amp;ldquo;tall and skinnies!&amp;rdquo; meaning high value, low cost). This
book was particularly useful because it explains the &lt;em>process&lt;/em> of software
development so well that you don&amp;rsquo;t actually need to be a developer to understand
it. That makes it much more useful for development-adjacent roles like product
management, QA, etc.&lt;/p>

>Inspired&lt;/a> by Marty Cagan and Chris Jones&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Speaking of product management, this book and &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55954021-empowered" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Empowered&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;
are aimed more at product managers. The Stratasan team read both of these books
as a group and I found them to be extremely helpful to communicate the vision
for a true product-first company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If &amp;ldquo;The Nature of Software Development&amp;rdquo; was a good introduction to software
development for product managers, &amp;ldquo;Inspired&amp;rdquo; was a great introduction to product
management for software developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="acceleratehttpswwwgoodreadscombookshow35747076-accelerate-by-forsgren-humble-and-kim">&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35747076-accelerate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Accelerate&lt;/a> by Forsgren, Humble, and Kim&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of my biggest gripes with most &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; books is that they rarely have
data to back them up. Instead, they tend to rely on overly cute anecdotes to
emphasize or validate their assertions. &amp;ldquo;Accelerate&amp;rdquo; does not make this mistake.
You might be able to point out issues with their data collection (that&amp;rsquo;s beyond
my pay grade) but they certainly have the data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This book highlights the engineering metrics that correlate best with successful
organizations, based on annual surveys performed by the authors. They boil it
down to four key metrics. I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of metrics for the sake of metrics, but
they make a very good case that these four metrics are really the ones you want
to watch.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-managers-pathhttpswwwgoodreadscombookshow33369254-the-manager-s-path-by-camille-fournier">&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33369254-the-manager-s-path" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The Manager&amp;rsquo;s Path&lt;/a> by Camille Fournier&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This book is broken out in a way that matches the trajectory of most careers in engineering management: from
individual contributor, to team lead, to manager of a single team, to multiple
teams, and then finally a manager of managers. This was a book I constantly kept
on hand as our company grew and I found myself referencing it often.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="high-output-managementhttpswwwgoodreadscomisbookshow324750high_output_management-by-andrew-grove">&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/is/book/show/324750.High_Output_Management" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>High Output Management&lt;/a> by Andrew Grove&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I found the title of this book off-putting at first. Some of the anecdotes and
recommendations are a bit heavy on the manufacturing side (not necessarily
suitable advice for the creative endeavor of a product company). However, it&amp;rsquo;s
good advice outweighed the anachronisms. It helped me understand a lot of the
reasoning behind OKRs. The single thing I took from this book: as a manager,
you&amp;rsquo;re no longer responsible for &lt;em>your&lt;/em> work; you&amp;rsquo;re now responsible for your
team&amp;rsquo;s work. Your job is now to help your team grow. I found this helpful as I
was transitioning from an individual contributor, because I still was very
tempted to measure my success based on &lt;em>my&lt;/em> output, not my teams. Trying to
balance individual output and managing a team is a miserable existence: this
book got me out of that hole.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tractionhttpswwwgoodreadscombookshow18886376-traction-by-gino-wickman">&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18886376-traction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Traction&lt;/a> by Gino Wickman&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This book might feel like the odd-one out in this anthology, but I include it
because it had a &lt;em>huge&lt;/em> influence on how we ran the day-to-day business at Stratasan.
Neither Jason Moore (CEO) nor myself had ever scaled a company to a hundred
people. This book and EOS helped us to set up a good cadence of meetings and
communication between the various teams. It allowed us to set the strategy,
execute on it, and bubble up issues more quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We eventually moved away from stick adherence to EOS, but it served us well as
a solid foundation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-about-you">What about you?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These are the books that I found to be most helpful during Stratasan&amp;rsquo;s growth.
How about you? What books were instrumental in your professional growth? Leave a
