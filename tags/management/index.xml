>EconTalk&lt;/a>) recently interviewed the author of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Collective-Edge-Unlocking-Secret-Groups/dp/0593715349?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=lfdigital-20&amp;amp;linkId=4a229d5d934af0ddcef559645112ae2a&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The Collective Edge: Unlocking the Secret Power of Groups&lt;/a>, Colin Fisher. There were two things about this excellent interview that stood out to me and merit further mulling on my part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you talk to me much about management, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that I&amp;rsquo;m pretty big on team trust and &lt;a class="link" href="https://hbr.org/2023/02/what-is-psychological-safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>psychological safety&lt;/a>. However, I&amp;rsquo;m not really big on &amp;ldquo;team building exercises.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve always been vaguely uneasy about them in ways that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t clearly articulate. I would participate in (or, on occasion, even lead) such things but I&amp;rsquo;d do it mostly because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be the stick-in-the-mud that said, &amp;ldquo;Well, I think this is rather silly.&amp;rdquo; Who am I to say? Maybe it &lt;em>is&lt;/em> useful and I&amp;rsquo;m just actually a stick in the mud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this podcast, Mr. Fisher made an excellent point that resonated with me. &amp;ldquo;Trust&amp;rdquo; can mean a variety of different things. Fisher broke &amp;ldquo;trust&amp;rdquo; down into two categories. Relational trust, also known as socio-emotional trust, addresses things like personal vulnerability (&amp;ldquo;If I share this information with my colleague, will they use it against me later?&amp;rdquo;) or emotional connection (&amp;ldquo;We all felt happy together about a group accomplishment, so we feel closer to one another&amp;rdquo;). Task-based trust is a little different, and it&amp;rsquo;s more common in the workplace setting. Namely, do I trust you to do the work in a manner that is acceptable to me? Do you follow-through on assignments and complete them competently?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Relational trust and task-based trust are not necessarily correlated. You can trust someone on an emotional level, but you may not trust them to complete work-related tasks competently. Team-building excercises address the former and not the latter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mr. Fisher makes the point that teams perform better when task-based trust is established first, and then relational trust (which is also important!) is established over time. When establishing trust for a team, Fisher recommends creating &amp;ldquo;high fidelity task simulations&amp;rdquo; in which the work is (hopefully) similar to the job description, allowing team members to communicate their competence in a more low-stakes environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second tidbit I got from this podcast is a pointer to Richard Hackman&amp;rsquo;s paper on &lt;a class="link" href="https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Group_Performance/Hackman_et_al_1976_Motivation_thru_the_design_of_work.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&amp;ldquo;Motivation through the Design of Work&amp;rdquo; (PDF)&lt;/a>, originally published in 1976. This discussion centered around how structuring the work has a strong effect on the intrinsic motivation of the team. This reminded me of how good managers often take a very active role in problem framing and decomposition. A good manager doesn&amp;rsquo;t just create a task, they establish how it fits into the bigger mission (framing) and breakdown the work into ways that make progress clear (helpful for managing both up and down the organization&amp;rsquo;s hierarchy).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole podcast is a great listen, lots of excellent tidbits! Give it a listen.&lt;/p>

As my responsibilities increased, it became more and more important to manage my own time well. This included not only using my time effectively, but also prioritizing the right things to work on. As a manager, the bulk of my time was spent in meetings and one-on-ones, but those meetings often &lt;em>produced&lt;/em> a lot of work that needed focus time. Finding time for that focus was always challenging. In my role as an advisor at &lt;a class="link" href="https://creollc.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Creo Advisory&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed this is an extremely common challenge for engineering managers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A managerâ€™s day is often split between many different calendar appointments (1:1s, syncs with senior leadership, etc) which makes it challenging to find any time for deep work. Much has been written about this elsewhere&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, starting with Paul Graham 2009 essay, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Maker&amp;rsquo;s Schedule, Manager&amp;rsquo;s Schedule&lt;/a>. Even beyond the non-coding kind of work that a manager needs to get done, there&amp;rsquo;s a strong argument to be made that engineering managers need to devote &lt;em>some&lt;/em> amount of time to, well, engineering.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many managers I speak to average about 30 hours a week or more in meetings. If you assume a 40 hour work week, that leaves 10 hours or less over a week to do everything else you need to do. Often, that 10 hours is randomly scattered across the week in 10-30 minute increments, which makes it &lt;em>extremely&lt;/em> challenging to find time to focus. As the heads-down work piles up, you become increasingly overwhelmed and important work may get dropped entirely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are three things that have helped alleviate this problem for me in the past.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Block off time for heads down work.&lt;/em> I strongly believe this is critical. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly difficult to concentrate on anything in short 30 minute bursts. Figure out what time of day works best for you and block off a minimum 2 hour chunk, if possible. For me, I was able to create a four hour block on Tuesday afternoons. Of course, sometimes things come up and you need to use that time for synchronous discussions, but it should be kept to a minimum.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Make sure that your manager and your team are aware of the problem and the need for focus.&lt;/em> There&amp;rsquo;s nothing more frustrating than attempting to allocate more time to heads-down work and having someone book over it for no good reason. Work with your team (both managers and your direct reports) to make sure they understand why you&amp;rsquo;re blocking time and what kinds of exceptions you have around booking over it. Use some of those management skills to sell the idea!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Find ways to signal to the team when you&amp;rsquo;re in focus time.&lt;/em> If you&amp;rsquo;re in an office, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to signal with various physical flags: wearing headphones, closing an office door (if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to have one), moving to a different physical location, etc. In a distributed environment, I have found it beneficial to signal &lt;a class="link" href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/11190973?hl=en&amp;amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>focus time&lt;/a> in group chat applications (e.g., Slack or Teams). You can often integrate your calendar with the group chat application to automatically change your status for you.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve sold your team on the idea and blocked off the time, it&amp;rsquo;s important to use that time wisely! &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Deep work&lt;/a> requires intentionality and effort, particularly when it comes to prioritization. Use it well. No pressure!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s no &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>silver bullet&lt;/a> here, but I believe that if you do these three things you will be a happier, more productive engineering manager.&lt;/p>
