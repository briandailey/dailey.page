might be useful for others. If you want to set up a Hugo-based blog that creates
a nice static site and publishes without too much work, then this is one way to
do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few components:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Blogging Framework (how posts get created)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The UI&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automatic Publishing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automatic Deployment&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-blogging-framework">The Blogging Framework&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a class="link" href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hugo&lt;/a>. It allows me to write blog posts as
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Markdown&lt;/a> (in my &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>favorite
text editor&lt;/a>). Using that Markdown, it builds all of the
HTML in my chosen theme, along with all of the menu navigation, tagging, RSS
feeds, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s quite nice!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also keep everything in version control via &lt;a class="link" href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>git&lt;/a>. That
allows me to track changes over time. All of the files used to generate the site
are &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/briandailey/dailey.page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>on GitHub&lt;/a> which serves as
both a backup and a way to automate publishing and deployment (more about that below).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-ui">The UI&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hugo Theme Stack&lt;/a> by
Jimmy Cai. It looks nice, and I&amp;rsquo;m generally terrible at front-end design.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automated-publishing">Automated Publishing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you write content for Hugo, there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a class="link" href="https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>build
step&lt;/a> that you run to generate the site.
The simplest way to do this is to just run it locally and copy the resulting
files somewhere (like Cloudfront or Amazon S3). If you do this, you need to
remember the build command, any specific parameters for your build, etc. I got
into programming because I hate tedium, and that, my friend, is &lt;em>tedious&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spoiled by modern build systems where I need only push my changes to
the main branch on GitHub and the robots do the rest. So let&amp;rsquo;s do that!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used an &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hugo-gh-pages-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>existing action in the GitHub
Marketplace&lt;/a> and
forked it to &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/briandailey/actions-hugo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>my own repo&lt;/a> to make
a &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/briandailey/actions-hugo/commit/3246cff7d82dfba2cf8f8518948e794a72aba14f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>slight
modification&lt;/a>
in order to override which branch we&amp;rsquo;re pushing the published works to. In this
case, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use &lt;code>gh-pages&lt;/code> because I want to publish the static site
to Cloudflare using the &lt;code>static&lt;/code> branch.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automated-deployment">Automated Deployment&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cloudflare has a &lt;a class="link" href="https://mattsayar.com/why-does-cloudflare-pages-have-such-a-generous-free-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>very generous free
tier&lt;/a>
that makes it really easy to publish static content from GitHub to a domain.
Once you have an account, you&amp;rsquo;ll find it under &amp;ldquo;Compute (Workers)&amp;rdquo; and then
&amp;ldquo;Workers &amp;amp; Pages.&amp;rdquo; From there, you can create a Page and hook it up to a
specific GitHub repository and branch. In this case, I hooked it up to the
&lt;code>static&lt;/code> branch. Once you assign all of the permissions and get the custom
domain set up, Cloudflare takes care of the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrapping-it-all">Wrapping It All&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So that&amp;rsquo;s it! Now when I want to publish a new post, I edit the files locally,
commit the changes and push them to the main branch on GitHub. From there,
GitHub builds the files and publishes to another branch, where Cloudflare picks
it up to host on their free tier.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Inspired by the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class="link" href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/02/friday-assorted-links-508.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>assorted links&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;
on Marginal Revolution and the &amp;ldquo;Highlights&amp;rdquo; on &lt;a class="link" href="https://simonwillison.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Simon Willison&amp;rsquo;s
blog&lt;/a>, I wanted to aggregate interesting things I
found during the week into a single post. To do this, I wrote a really &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/briandailey/weeklylink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>terrible
little script&lt;/a> to accumulate links
that I post to &lt;a class="link" href="https://pinboard.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Pinboard&lt;/a> with the &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; tag. You
can see what the first post created in this manner
&lt;a class="link" href="https://dailey.page/p/weekly-assorted-things-2025-02-14/" >here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Goodbye Stratasan, Hello World</title><link>https://dailey.page/p/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dailey.page/p/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://dailey.page/p/hello-world/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Goodbye Stratasan, Hello World" />&lt;p>(I used to blog at &lt;a class="link" href="https://dailytechnology.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>dailytechnology.net&lt;/a> and will keep the
old Jekyll-based blog around just for historical purposes.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2022, I ended a long tenure working for Stratasan, the company that I
co-founded with Jason Moore back in 2011. It has been a huge part of my career
and I doubt I will ever get to experience anything like it again.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I say that not because it was a successful company but because of the kinds of
people I got to work with. Ten years from now, I won&amp;rsquo;t remember much about the
business strategy, the technical architecture, the effort we put into solid
ecurity patterns, or the roadmap priorities. What I&amp;rsquo;ll remember is the people,
and how it felt to work with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stratasan was special because our engineering and product
teams had a very high level of trust. If you have spent much time with Jason Moore, you
would learn that he is a special kind of leader. A lot of leaders like you to
think they know absolutely everything. Leaders must project confidence, yes, but
they also need to acknowledge that they can&amp;rsquo;t know &lt;em>everything&lt;/em>, and Jason Moore
walked that balance very well. Since leaders set the tone for the rest of the
company, this vulnerability cascaded down to new hires and became part of our culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I learned a lot at Stratasan. Every year or so my job description completely
changed. There are some things that I would have done differently. As an
engineer, I was used to fast feedback: if you do something silly, hopefully you
have some unit tests that fail and you go fix it. Management is completely
different. When you do something stupid, sometimes you don&amp;rsquo;t know just how
stupid it was for weeks or even months. When I did make a mistake, I tried to
learn from it.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s next for me? I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure. At this time, I have many personal
things that require my attention, so I am taking a pause to reassess my
priorities and decide what I want to spend my time on next. One thing I do know
that I&amp;rsquo;d like to do again is write, so that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve set this up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See you next time!&lt;/p>
