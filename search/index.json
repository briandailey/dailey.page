If you want to set up a Hugo-based blog that creates a nice static site and publishes without too much work, then this is one way to do it.\nThere are a few components:\nThe Blogging Framework (how posts get created) The UI Automatic Publishing Automatic Deployment The Blogging Framework I\u0026rsquo;m using Hugo. It allows me to write blog posts as Markdown (in my favorite text editor). Using that Markdown, it builds all of the HTML in my chosen theme, along with all of the menu navigation, tagging, RSS feeds, etc. It\u0026rsquo;s quite nice!\nI also keep everything in version control via git. That allows me to track changes over time. All of the files used to generate the site are on GitHub which serves as both a backup and a way to automate publishing and deployment (more about that below).\nThe UI I\u0026rsquo;m using Hugo Theme Stack by Jimmy Cai. It looks nice, and I\u0026rsquo;m generally terrible at front-end design.\nAutomated Publishing When you write content for Hugo, there\u0026rsquo;s a build step that you run to generate the site. The simplest way to do this is to just run it locally and copy the resulting files somewhere (like Cloudfront or Amazon S3). If you do this, you need to remember the build command, any specific parameters for your build, etc. I got into programming because I hate tedium, and that, my friend, is tedious.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been spoiled by modern build systems where I need only push my changes to the main branch on GitHub and the robots do the rest. So let\u0026rsquo;s do that!\nI used an existing action in the GitHub Marketplace and forked it to my own repo to make a slight modification in order to override which branch we\u0026rsquo;re pushing the published works to. In this case, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to use gh-pages because I want to publish the static site to Cloudflare using the static branch.\nAutomated Deployment Cloudflare has a very generous free tier that makes it really easy to publish static content from GitHub to a domain. Once you have an account, you\u0026rsquo;ll find it under \u0026ldquo;Compute (Workers)\u0026rdquo; and then \u0026ldquo;Workers \u0026amp; Pages.\u0026rdquo; From there, you can create a Page and hook it up to a specific GitHub repository and branch. In this case, I hooked it up to the static branch. Once you assign all of the permissions and get the custom domain set up, Cloudflare takes care of the rest.\nWrapping It All So that\u0026rsquo;s it! Now when I want to publish a new post, I edit the files locally, commit the changes and push them to the main branch on GitHub. From there, GitHub builds the files and publishes to another branch, where Cloudflare picks it up to host on their free tier.\nBonus: Automated RSS Ingestion for \u0026ldquo;Weekly Posts\u0026rdquo; Inspired by the \u0026ldquo;assorted links\u0026rdquo; on Marginal Revolution and the \u0026ldquo;Highlights\u0026rdquo; on Simon Willison\u0026rsquo;s blog, I wanted to aggregate interesting things I found during the week into a single post.

After committing over a decade to a startup, I was ready for a change of pace for a time.\nI had two major goals in mind coming into 2024:\nMake \u0026ldquo;small bets\u0026rdquo; on side projects that might gain traction (either on my own or with a business partner). Leverage my experience in the healthcare B2B SaaS (yes, it\u0026rsquo;s very specific) sector to earn income. In 2024, my only \u0026ldquo;small bet\u0026rdquo; was Calendaristic. I spent more time in the first quarter of the year on this than any other quarter. As my consulting work (under Creo Advisory) became more demanding, side projects became more difficult to focus on.\nWhat else happened in 2024, broadly speaking?\nI co-founded the Nashville CTO Club with Josh Segall and Jim Siegienski. I started Tech Founder Community to try to connect with other engineering founders and co-founders. I connected with a lot of people in 2024. I continue to believe that this is the primary way that serendipity strikes. According to Google Calendar, I met with over 400 people in 2024. Calendly was a life-saver here. Many conversations started off with a meeting at some local event (Haley Zapolski and Josh Segall hosted many of these) or events at the Nashville Entrepreneur Center. A good many of these were referrals from folks I have worked with or for in the past. Referrals are the best compliment I can receive! What went well? The Nashville CTO Club got off to a great start in September. Kudos to Mr. Segall for being the primary driver of this thing. It\u0026rsquo;s obvious that Josh hosts a lot of events, because he though of a lot of details that I simply would not have considered. It gave this group needed structure. The consulting / fractional business continued to do well. I was able to focus on clients that I felt I offerred the highest value (in my particular niche, relevant to my past experience) and turn down potential work for which I did not feel well-suited. A breakdown of how I billed categories is below. \u0026ldquo;P\u0026amp;E\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;Product and Engineering\u0026rdquo; - basically technical due diligence but for an organization instead of an investor. I was able to (mostly) stick to a four-day-a-week work schedule, which allowed me to prioritize more time with my family. About halfway through the year I found myself doing a lot of interviewing for CTO and VPoE roles (I was the interviewer on behalf of my client). Given that this was somewhat of a rarity when I worked at one company, I used the opportunity to leverage the repitition here in order to improve my interview process. As Annie Dukes said, you can\u0026rsquo;t just gain experience by letting things wash over you; you have to be intentional about it! I feel like intentionally improving on my interviewing skills bore fruit. What didn\u0026rsquo;t go well? The Tech Founder Community languished. In June, it seemed like a doable thing. In July, baby #6 joined our family and I had forgotten just how much a new baby can take the wind out of your sails (especially in your forties!). I spent so much time on Creo Advisory that I failed to get any other side projects off of the ground. What are my goals for 2025? I will launch three side projects into production in 2025. Two of these are known and in-progress. The third is a TBD. I will block off more time for reading and writing. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to spend so much time on the application (consulting, building) that no time is spent learning and reflecting. I\u0026rsquo;ll promote useful engagement within the Tech Founder Community, further refining it\u0026rsquo;s purpose and mission. Other Thoughts Presumably, I\u0026rsquo;m often hired as fractional CTO to help with the engineering team. But often I find that I spend more time with company leadership thinking about business strategy. Business strategy affects engineering strategy and vice versa. This is something that I enjoyed and would love to do more of. However, I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure if I want to market myself as some kind of strategic advisor!\nBonus: Favorite business-related books of the year? This one is easy! Everything is Predictable by Tom Chivers and Thinking in Bets by Annie Dukes. The former I found via Five Books and the latter was via a conversation with Prakesh Sripathy.

As my responsibilities increased, it became more and more important to manage my own time well. This included not only using my time effectively, but also prioritizing the right things to work on. As a manager, the bulk of my time was spent in meetings and one-on-ones, but those meetings often produced a lot of work that needed focus time. Finding time for that focus was always challenging. In my role as an advisor at Creo Advisory I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed this is an extremely common challenge for engineering managers.\nA manager’s day is often split between many different calendar appointments (1:1s, syncs with senior leadership, etc) which makes it challenging to find any time for deep work. Much has been written about this elsewhere1, starting with Paul Graham 2009 essay, Maker\u0026rsquo;s Schedule, Manager\u0026rsquo;s Schedule. Even beyond the non-coding kind of work that a manager needs to get done, there\u0026rsquo;s a strong argument to be made that engineering managers need to devote some amount of time to, well, engineering.2\nMany managers I speak to average about 30 hours a week or more in meetings. If you assume a 40 hour work week, that leaves 10 hours or less over a week to do everything else you need to do. Often, that 10 hours is randomly scattered across the week in 10-30 minute increments, which makes it extremely challenging to find time to focus. As the heads-down work piles up, you become increasingly overwhelmed and important work may get dropped entirely.\nHere are three things that have helped alleviate this problem for me in the past.\nBlock off time for heads down work. I strongly believe this is critical. It\u0026rsquo;s incredibly difficult to concentrate on anything in short 30 minute bursts. Figure out what time of day works best for you and block off a minimum 2 hour chunk, if possible. For me, I was able to create a four hour block on Tuesday afternoons. Of course, sometimes things come up and you need to use that time for synchronous discussions, but it should be kept to a minimum. Make sure that your manager and your team are aware of the problem and the need for focus. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing more frustrating than attempting to allocate more time to heads-down work and having someone book over it for no good reason. Work with your team (both managers and your direct reports) to make sure they understand why you\u0026rsquo;re blocking time and what kinds of exceptions you have around booking over it. Use some of those management skills to sell the idea! Find ways to signal to the team when you\u0026rsquo;re in focus time. If you\u0026rsquo;re in an office, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to signal with various physical flags: wearing headphones, closing an office door (if you\u0026rsquo;re lucky enough to have one), moving to a different physical location, etc. In a distributed environment, I have found it beneficial to signal focus time in group chat applications (e.g., Slack or Teams). You can often integrate your calendar with the group chat application to automatically change your status for you. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve sold your team on the idea and blocked off the time, it\u0026rsquo;s important to use that time wisely! Deep work requires intentionality and effort, particularly when it comes to prioritization. Use it well. No pressure!\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no silver bullet here, but I believe that if you do these three things you will be a happier, more productive engineering manager.\nMaker vs. Manager: How Your Schedule Can Make or Break You\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nRands on Technicality\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2024-02-15T00:00:00Z","image":"https://dailey.page/p/focus-for-engineering-managers/cover_hu2d0ebfca14ba58e5de360eac8f7b5e55_734769_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://dailey.page/p/focus-for-engineering-managers/","title":"3 Practical Tips For Finding Focus As An Engineering Manager"},{"content":"A few weeks ago, I asked on LinkedIn why there aren\u0026rsquo;t more companies in the Southeast started by engineers. It prompted a lot of great conversations both online and offline. The tl;dr: I\u0026rsquo;m starting a group in Nashville for engineers-turned-entrepreneurs. You can sign up or read more about the details at techfounder.community.\nWhat is the Tech Founder Community? Taken from the website:\nThe goal of this community is to encourage and enable engineers to leverage their technical and domain expertise to build a thriving business. We do this by connecting interested folks in local networks with peers, mentors, advisors, and maybe even capital.\nNashville already has a lot of startup-type groups. Why one more? The short version: existing support networks in Nashville do not target engineering audiences.\nNashville does have a lot of great things going for it. Programs like the Nashville Entrepreneur Center Pre-Flight and Inflight programs are really great ways to support growing businesses. However, this tends to support either business development types (think MBA graduates) or domain experts. This tends to lead to a lot of business founders looking for \u0026ldquo;technical co-founders\u0026rdquo;, often in exchange for sweat equity1.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also a very active engineering community in Nashville. Many of them have either launched their own business or have considered doing so. According to one survey from Packt in 2018, 1 in 3 software developers hope to found their own company.\nThe phenomenon of engineer-turned-entrepreneur is embraced in many coastal cities, but this simply isn\u0026rsquo;t the case in middle America. I want to change that, at least for Nashville, by providing a peer support network, veteran mentors, and more. We can leverage existing infrastructure (like the EC) where appropriate but focus on enabling and encouraging folks with a technical background.\nWhat makes you think you\u0026rsquo;re qualified to host this group? I\u0026rsquo;m both an engineer and entrepreneur. I started writing software professionally in 2000, and started my first company in 2004. I co-founded Stratasan in 2011, grew it to about 100 people, and then exited in 2022. I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of the \u0026ldquo;open concept\u0026rdquo; meetups. I was an active participant in OpenCoffee circa 2008 (that\u0026rsquo;s me in the center of a photo on Fred Wilson\u0026rsquo;s blog). I\u0026rsquo;ve seen how useful these informal groups can be in encouraging an ecosystem of peer support. I have experience managing communities. In fact, I met my wife on such a community (that I started) back in the mid-90s (that\u0026rsquo;s some nerd-cred, right?). When I moved from engineer to manager, I started a monthly breakfast group for engineers-turned-managers ten years ago. Why now, in 2024? The macroeconomic big picture. We\u0026rsquo;re in a weird time. The tech economy is struggling. Due to lay-offs, a lot of engineers have some free time on their hands. Some of them have fairly nice severance packages. What better time to dip your toes into entrepreneurship? With all of the tech lay-offs, many of us are wondering how we can control our own destiny. You\u0026rsquo;ve poured your heart into a company. The upside is the company does well and you make someone else a lot of money. The downside is you get unceremoniously cut when the economy lags (or management makes poor decisions).2 \u0026ldquo;Job stability\u0026rdquo; is not so much, so you might as well roll the dice and potentially see some upside. Economic slowdowns are the time to start a company! COVID19 made many re-evaluate what they\u0026rsquo;re doing. Some have chosen to prioritize lifestyle changes (reduced working hours). Few companies are willing to hire folks at less than 40 hours a week, so that narrows options down to starting your own thing. I\u0026rsquo;m interested, where do I sign up? If you\u0026rsquo;re interested and in Nashville, go to the Tech Founder Community website and find the \u0026ldquo;Sign up\u0026rdquo; link. You\u0026rsquo;ll also find additional information on the vision for this and the approach I\u0026rsquo;m taking.\nGiven that an experienced software developer can (often) bring home a six figure salary, sweat equity often does not make sense. An experienced software developer still has overhead expenses to pay (housing, healthcare, etc).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nI have had a lot of conversations with entrepreneurs who worked under poor management and it made them think, \u0026ldquo;I could do better job running a company than these knuckleheads.\u0026rdquo; Prove it!\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2024-01-31T09:53:41-06:00","image":"https://dailey.page/p/tech-founder-community-nashville/cover_hube0534e8833c5596d593b6e012d58966_563806_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://dailey.page/p/tech-founder-community-nashville/","title":"Tech Founder Community: Nashville"},{"content":"Since leaving Stratasan (acquired by Syntellis) in March of 2023 I started out doing some advisory and technical due diligence work for investors. I\u0026rsquo;m still doing advisory and diligence work, but I\u0026rsquo;ve also found demand for my help as a fractional CTO.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a fractional CTO? You might as well ask, \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s a Chief Technology Officer (CTO)?\u0026rdquo; It varies a lot from company to company (based on size, structure, and type of product) but in general Wikipedia has a satisfactory (although wordy) answer. If I had to boil it down, I\u0026rsquo;d say that \u0026ldquo;the CTO makes sure that the technology strategy aligns well with the business strategy and executes the technology strategy.\u0026rdquo;\nA fractional CTO does much of the same thing, but on a part-time (fractional) basis, often working with more than one company at a time. Just like a full-time CTO, a fractional CTO will often specialize in one industry or company stage of growth.\nIn my case, I work often with startups and early stage companies in the healthcare sector. There are three things that make my career relevant to this particular niche:\nI have a amassed a wide range of experience in the healthcare sector across nearly a quarter century (I got my start in 2000). I have spent most of my career in startups and early stage companies in New York and Nashville, and have myself been a co-founder with a successful nine-figure exit. I know excatly what it\u0026rsquo;s like to wear all of the hats, find product-market fit, and scale a team! Given my experience with technical due diligence (on both ends of the transaction), I am familiar with the markers that investors are looking for in a company. The confluence of these three areas of experience have left me well suited to serve as an advisor to the non-technical founders and leadership of startups.\nTechnology strategy has a give-and-take relationship with business strategy My job is to fully understand and internalize the business strategy, determine technical feasibility, and then build a roadmap that combines the two.\nWhat kinds of things do you do as a fractional CTO? Honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s all over the map (hence the title of this, \u0026ldquo;the wide world\u0026rdquo;!), and that\u0026rsquo;s one of the things that I love about it. Here are some examples of projects that I have done over the summer:\nDiagnose the current reality (what we have) and identify gaps based on the business strategy (what we need) and build a roadmap to get there. This has ranged from early stage startups (the whole business runs in an Excel spreadsheet!) to scaling growth companies. Advise companies that are looking to hire their first full time engineer and subsequent team members. This covers everything from sourcing leads, interviewing, hiring, and then advising them while they ramp up. Perform a \u0026ldquo;pre-sale inspection\u0026rdquo; for early stage companies. In short, I evaluate them as an investor might do in order to best prepare them for a transaction. I write more about the variety of things I do here.\nUsually, any engagement with a company lasts only 2-3 months. My goal is not to embed myself in an organization forever: I\u0026rsquo;m there to help build a plan, get things on track, and coach the team as needed.\nHow do I know if I need a fractional CTO? There are a few signs that it might be useful to bring on an fCTO:\nYour primary product is a SaaS tool, but no one on the leadership team has technology experience. A fractional CTO can work on your side of the table to make sure that the technology roadmap supports the business strategy, that any outsourced development work is not incurring unnecessary technology debt, and to keep the momentum going. Your development lead is highly technical, but not strategic. An fCTO can help your team think more strategically and balance the technology roadmap with the business\u0026rsquo;s needs. You need a CTO, but you can\u0026rsquo;t afford one full-time. A fractional hire may be what you need to fit your budget. Your technology roadmap has gone off track. You need an experienced leader to diagnose the problem, recommend new processes, and get things back on track quickly. You anticipate a business milestone (e.g., a round of funding, an aquisition, or a major new product). An experienced fCTO can help you avoid pitfalls and build a plan for success.

In March of 2020, that all changed and we went 100% distributed.\nLike many small companies in the before-times, we worked out of an office with a small number of conference rooms. We used shared calendars to book the rooms. If a meeting went over time, participants had to wrap up and exit so the new meeting could get started.\nThis served as a forcing function in a few ways:\nThe availability of meeting rooms put an artificial ceiling on the number of meetings we could have at any time. Meetings had to end on time so the room could be made available for the next group. Recurring meetings were trickier to set up because one needed to check for room availability. Meetings were also visible. You could see when folks were huddling (whether in a conference room or at a desk). I\u0026rsquo;m neutral on whether the above is good or bad. But it did serve to make meetings more scarce, and scarcity increases value. If you have fewer meetings, it forces you to be more intentional with how the time is spent.\nWhen we left the office, all of that disappeared.\nMeetings proliferated (anecdotally, but with some data to back it up). In particular, recurring meetings seemed to proliferate. Meetings went over time more frequently. \u0026ldquo;Does anyone here have a hard stop?\u0026rdquo; became a common question. Meetings seemed to carry a higher cognitive load on participants.1 We did a lot to try to mitigate some of what we were seeing. Several of us configured \u0026ldquo;speedy meetings\u0026rdquo;2. We performed periodic \u0026ldquo;recurring meeting resets\u0026rdquo; where we cleared recurring meetings and only set up the ones we thought were absolutely necessary. We encouraged detailed agendas. We set up a \u0026ldquo;one-pager\u0026rdquo; that detailed how we do meetings in order to try to make them more efficient.\nI think some of this worked. But I can\u0026rsquo;t be sure, because the data either didn\u0026rsquo;t exist or was very tedious to gather. We could get some calendar statistics by doing spot checks. I could look at my calendar as well as some of my team members. There is some calendar analytics built into the Google Workspace dashboard, but it was too high level to really get any useful information from.\nWhat I really wanted was a nice dashboard to monitor how we were doing. In particular, I wanted to trend it over time. I had many questions. Among them:\nIs our meeting burden (average per person) trending up or down? How high is too high? Break it down by recurring versus one-offs. How many meetings have an agenda? How many have a good agenda? Break down averages in a few ways: By department. By internal vs. external participants. Since \u0026ldquo;speedy meetings\u0026rdquo; are only configurable on the account level, who are the folks who are not taking advantage of that setting? There are lots of other questions I want to answer, but these are the ones I started with.\nThere are lots of great calendar tools out there. But all of them, in my experience, are targeted at the individual user, not operators. I wanted a tool that would look at my Google Workspace domain and run the analytics on everyone in the company, not just me and/or my team.\nSince I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to find such a tool, I\u0026rsquo;m building it in Calendaristic.\nI am looking for a handful of companies that can test this with me as it\u0026rsquo;s being developed.

My work is performed with Creo Advisory, LLC.\nAdvisory Work While at Stratasan I found myself doing a lot of things I hadn\u0026rsquo;t done before (as one does when you grow a company from two to about a hundred employees). Going from engineer to lead engineer to manager to manager of managers meant that about every two years my job description changed drastically.\nTo keep up, I did an inordinate amount of reading. I also relied heavily on discussions with peers. One thing that I found extremely useful was finding trusted advisors to work with. They served as both experienced voices and trusted soundboards. Often I had an idea of what I needed to do, I just needed to walk through it with someone and have them tell me, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, that makes sense. No, you\u0026rsquo;re not crazy.\u0026rdquo; Having an advisor not otherwise tied to the company would also extract me from the day-to-day grind and help me see the larger strategy. In short, I found having advisors to be very valuable.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also served as an advisor to other companies. Given how engaged I was at Stratasan, I could not do this as much as I would have liked. Post-exit, I have more time to devote to this.\nOne interesting thing about advisors is that the same advisor is not always useful in every situation. Each time I found a good advisor, there was a process of determining the subject matter expertise I needed most (product management? security/compliance? engineering?) and reviewing potential candidates for personality fit. I have worked with some folks who I was able to help for a time and after a while they no longer needed what I could provide. Advisor relationships are rarely permanent, and it\u0026rsquo;s important for the advisor and advisee to know when it\u0026rsquo;s no longer worth the investment of time.\nTechnical Due Diligence I\u0026rsquo;ve been through a handful of technical due diligence processes. During each one, I always thought about ways to make it easier on the prospective company. They varied from \u0026ldquo;Wow, that felt entirely cursory\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Holy smokes, this goes into a very unnecessary level of detail!\u0026rdquo; I hope to leverage this experience to run a technical due diligence process that minimizes the time necessary from the prospective company as well as maximizing usefulness for the investor or acquiring company.\nWhat makes you qualified? That\u0026rsquo;s a fair question! There are a couple attributes that make both an advisor or technical reviewer successful:\nA wide base of underlying experience. I have worked in technology since 2000, giving me almost a quarter of a century of experience across a wide array of startups across many technology stacks and industries. Much of what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned about successfully running teams is applicable to pretty much any industry independent of the specific technology stack. A history as an operator. Many consultants and advisors purport to have some kind of system or process that will resolve all your business problems (the proverbial \u0026ldquo;silver bullet\u0026rdquo;). Rarely do these folks have actual experience operating a business. The best advisors and investors that I\u0026rsquo;ve worked with all had prior experience as an operator. Ideal project? Given my experience, I\u0026rsquo;m better suited to working as an advisor or doing technical diligence on startup and early stage companies with 5-100 employees. My domain expertise is heavily in healthcare and my technical experience is focused predominately on open-source stacks.\nGreat, how do I find out more or get in touch?

Ultimately, he makes the point that \u0026ldquo;being right doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if you can\u0026rsquo;t build consensus.\u0026rdquo;\nI wholeheartedly agree with this. As I was reading his post, I was reminded of a recent story that I heard on EconTalk1 about a Hungarian physician and scientist, Ignaz Semmelweis. He noted that the doctors\u0026rsquo; ward had triple the mortality rate as the midwives\u0026rsquo; ward in his obstetric clinic. At the time, it was normal for doctors to carve up a cadaver in the morgue, wear the blood proudly on their apron (it was a badge to indicate just how hard they were working), and go straight to the labor and delivery rooms. Cleanliness was simply not a priority. Semmelweis noted that if he washed his hands in chlorinated lime solution the patient mortality rate dropped to 1%.\nHe accumulated some evidence to back up his claims and published, hoping to save tens of thousands of lives. However, his claims were not well received. The wider medical field rejected Semmelweis\u0026rsquo;s claims and his impact was not as significant as he had hoped. Semmelwies died at 47 of blood poisoning in an insane asylum just a few years prior to his ideas becoming more widely accepted.\nSome of this reaction might be due to what Megan McArdle called the \u0026ldquo;Oedipus trap\u0026rdquo; (humans have a hard time reconciling the fact that their decisions may have caused a significant amount of harm, even if they were unintentional). It didn\u0026rsquo;t help that Semmelweis had a reputation of being a difficult guy to work with. He considered himself very smart and felt that his experimental studies should have been sufficient to convince others that he was right.\n\u0026hellip; Dr. Semmelwies also didn\u0026rsquo;t do himself any favors. [\u0026hellip;] He went out of his way to attack doctors who rejected his thesis, devoting a full sixty-four pages of one of his publications to attack a single obstetrician from Prague who questioned his results.2\nThis scenario is much more dramatic than anything we’d run into (we’re rarely contradicting the popular opinion of an entire profession) but if we agree that group think is bad, then we can agree that there are advantages for organizations to have a dissenting voice. It\u0026rsquo;s what Todd Kashdan delightfully calls \u0026ldquo;principled insubordination.\u0026rdquo;\nWith a single rebel airing alternate and unpopular views, a group reduces its confirmation bias and motivated reasoning and increases its creative output.3\nIn Kashdan\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Art of Insubordination,\u0026rdquo; he spends the first few chapters presenting all of the evidence that we need skeptics. This is especially true in any organization where the work involves both creativity and complexity. Creative and complex endeavors (which applies to most product-first organizations) benefit from people who are willing to speak up in situations where they may be contradicting popular opinion (\u0026ldquo;group think\u0026rdquo;). Skeptical viewpoints can encourage more thoughtful discussion.\nHowever, the issue is that many organizations do not encourage skepticism. On the contrary, they often suppress it. If you\u0026rsquo;ve seen a leader respond defensively to a question asked in good faith, then you\u0026rsquo;ve seen this happen. Unhealthy peace is often prioritized over healthy conflict. Furthermore, it only takes is one poor reaction to a challenging question to effectively silence all future questions.\nThis leads to an environment where only the boldest or most adversarial team members will express skepticism. In short: if an environment is hostile to dissenting opinions, then the only dissenting opinions will be hostile.\nErgo, we need to build environments where contrary opinions are welcomed and rewarded so that we can benefit from sharper critical thinking from our teams.\nWhat can you as a manager or leader do to encourage principled insubordination? Here are four specific things.\nFirst, be vulnerable. This take courage and is often uncomfortable. Brene Brown really does a great job of explaining this in Dare To Lead. Leadership must demonstrate that they can’t know all of the things and that they are open to changing course. If leadership is not open to criticism, they will receive none, and the organization will be worse for it. Coach. There’s a fine line between being a skeptic (challenging commonly accepted opinions, good) and a cynic (believing that others are not acting in good faith, bad). A cynical person might be recovering from a previous job where they were not able to ask (or, worse, punished for asking) critical questions, but with the right encouragement they might be converted into a skeptic. Other team members might just need a little help challenging opinions in a diplomatic, constructive way. Solicit. Solicitation of feedback is often required because many people are reluctant to provide honest feedback because they\u0026rsquo;ve learned that leaders don’t react well. Keeping your head down is a good strategy in many organizations, so you have to work to solicit dissenting opinions. Reward. Even solicitation may not be effective if some team members have had poor experiences raising objections in the past. Hence, rewarding those that speak up is critical as it signals to everyone else that disagreement is encouraged. Asking for clarification, seeking to understand, answering questions in good faith and, most importantly, changing course when merited: all of this indicates to the team that managers and leaders are open to constructive feedback. This short list might make it sound easy, but as any leader would know, it is most certainly not. A rush of adrenaline is a fundamental human reaction to contradiction, propelling us toward a vigorous verbal defense. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to tamp that immediate reaction down and listen. Listening can take the form of asking clarifying questions, surfacing the underlying problem.\nOnce those voices have been heard and addressed in good faith, then the team can move on, even if it means that some parties have to disagree and commit. By being vulnerable, coaching, soliciting opinions, and rewarding dissent organizations can continue to benefit from critical thinking and avoid the trap of artificial consensus.\n(You might be saying, \u0026ldquo;Alright, that\u0026rsquo;s all well and good, Brian, what if I\u0026rsquo;m not a manager? What if I am the skeptic?\u0026rdquo; Well, carry on, I say! If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for ways to be more effective, then I recommend checking out \u0026ldquo;The Art of Insubordination: How to Dissent and Defy Effectively\u0026rdquo; by Todd Kashdan.)\nPhoto from Bing Image Creator.\nMarch 20, 2023 EconTalk episode with Megan McArdle\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nQuote from Kashdan, \u0026ldquo;The Art of Insubordination, page 64.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nQuote from Kashdan, \u0026ldquo;The Art of Insubordination, page 53.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2023-04-05T00:00:00Z","image":"https://dailey.page/p/celebrate-the-skeptics/cover_hucb2f77aeb8943ce1c5848a7d2907db6e_81780_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://dailey.page/p/celebrate-the-skeptics/","title":"Celebrate the Skeptics"},{"content":"As I am nearing the end of my tenure at the company I co-founded a decade ago, I thought it would be useful to share some of the books that were influential to me as I went from engineer to a lead-of-leads.\nCode Complete by Steve McConnell This book probably feels a bit dated as it was published in 2004. However, I found this very useful early in my engineering career as I was learning to build systems that were maintainable and useful. Some of the maxims that McConnell included in this book are true no matter the language. For example, \u0026ldquo;write programs for people first, computers second.\u0026rdquo; I often had a tendency to get clever with code rather than trying to be blindingly obvious; being clever tended to produce more pain (both for myself and others) down the road.\nThe Mythical Man Month: Essays on Software Engineering by Fred Brooks This book makes \u0026ldquo;Code Complete\u0026rdquo; feel quite young as \u0026ldquo;Mythical\u0026rdquo; was written in 1975. However, it\u0026rsquo;s commentary on software development is still timeless (if one can overlook some of the underlying sexism prevalent at the time). Two essays stuck with me more than others.\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s No Silver Bullet\u0026rdquo; highlighted accidental complexity versus essential complexity. Much work has been done to address accidental complexity (especially since 1975!) but essential complexity, the complexity of the underlying problems that we\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve, will always be with us. This one stuck with me because non-engineering types are constantly enamoured by \u0026ldquo;silver bullets\u0026rdquo; - whether it\u0026rsquo;s data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or whatever is coming next. Whenever they come upon a hard problem they ask, \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t we just use [the silver bullet]?\u0026rdquo; Even engineers like myself can fall prey to this way of thinking. The trouble is that these bullets rarely address the complexity of the underlying problem space.\nIn \u0026ldquo;The Mythical Man Month\u0026rdquo; Brooks asserts that \u0026ldquo;adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.\u0026rdquo; He highlights the importance of team communication in complex projects and provides a formula to demonstrate that more people means more and more communication overhead. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard this described by someone else as \u0026ldquo;clinks versus drinks.\u0026rdquo; If you sit at a bar with three people, you clink three times and then you can drink. But as you add more and more people to the party, all of your time is spent clinking with very little time for drinking!\nThe Nature of Software Development by Ron Jeffries Ron Jeffries is one of the original signatories of the agile manifesto. The manifesto has been pillaged and plundered by consultants until it has become something completely unrecognizable from the original intent. This book brings it all back home. We\u0026rsquo;re just here to deliver value to our customers!\nThe Stratasan and product and engineering teams read this as a group at least twice. I found it to be extremely useful to help everyone get on the same page about how a product-first company delivers value to customers. It helped us use similar vocabulary (\u0026ldquo;tall and skinnies!\u0026rdquo; meaning high value, low cost). This book was particularly useful because it explains the process of software development so well that you don\u0026rsquo;t actually need to be a developer to understand it. That makes it much more useful for development-adjacent roles like product management, QA, etc.\nInspired by Marty Cagan and Chris Jones Speaking of product management, this book and \u0026ldquo;Empowered\u0026rdquo; are aimed more at product managers. The Stratasan team read both of these books as a group and I found them to be extremely helpful to communicate the vision for a true product-first company.\nIf \u0026ldquo;The Nature of Software Development\u0026rdquo; was a good introduction to software development for product managers, \u0026ldquo;Inspired\u0026rdquo; was a great introduction to product management for software developers.\nAccelerate by Forsgren, Humble, and Kim One of my biggest gripes with most \u0026ldquo;business\u0026rdquo; books is that they rarely have data to back them up. Instead, they tend to rely on overly cute anecdotes to emphasize or validate their assertions. \u0026ldquo;Accelerate\u0026rdquo; does not make this mistake. You might be able to point out issues with their data collection (that\u0026rsquo;s beyond my pay grade) but they certainly have the data.\nThis book highlights the engineering metrics that correlate best with successful organizations, based on annual surveys performed by the authors. They boil it down to four key metrics. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of metrics for the sake of metrics, but they make a very good case that these four metrics are really the ones you want to watch.\nThe Manager\u0026rsquo;s Path by Camille Fournier This book is broken out in a way that matches the trajectory of most careers in engineering management: from individual contributor, to team lead, to manager of a single team, to multiple teams, and then finally a manager of managers. This was a book I constantly kept on hand as our company grew and I found myself referencing it often.\nHigh Output Management by Andrew Grove I found the title of this book off-putting at first. Some of the anecdotes and recommendations are a bit heavy on the manufacturing side (not necessarily suitable advice for the creative endeavor of a product company). However, it\u0026rsquo;s good advice outweighed the anachronisms. It helped me understand a lot of the reasoning behind OKRs. The single thing I took from this book: as a manager, you\u0026rsquo;re no longer responsible for your work; you\u0026rsquo;re now responsible for your team\u0026rsquo;s work. Your job is now to help your team grow. I found this helpful as I was transitioning from an individual contributor, because I still was very tempted to measure my success based on my output, not my teams. Trying to balance individual output and managing a team is a miserable existence: this book got me out of that hole.\nTraction by Gino Wickman This book might feel like the odd-one out in this anthology, but I include it because it had a huge influence on how we ran the day-to-day business at Stratasan. Neither Jason Moore (CEO) nor myself had ever scaled a company to a hundred people. This book and EOS helped us to set up a good cadence of meetings and communication between the various teams. It allowed us to set the strategy, execute on it, and bubble up issues more quickly.\nWe eventually moved away from stick adherence to EOS, but it served us well as a solid foundation.\nWhat about you? These are the books that I found to be most helpful during Stratasan\u0026rsquo;s growth. How about you? What books were instrumental in your professional growth?

It has been a huge part of my career and I doubt I will ever get to experience anything like it again.1\nI say that not because it was a successful company but because of the kinds of people I got to work with. Ten years from now, I won\u0026rsquo;t remember much about the business strategy, the technical architecture, the effort we put into solid ecurity patterns, or the roadmap priorities. What I\u0026rsquo;ll remember is the people, and how it felt to work with them.\nStratasan was special because our engineering and product teams had a very high level of trust. If you have spent much time with Jason Moore, you would learn that he is a special kind of leader. A lot of leaders like you to think they know absolutely everything. Leaders must project confidence, yes, but they also need to acknowledge that they can\u0026rsquo;t know everything, and Jason Moore walked that balance very well. Since leaders set the tone for the rest of the company, this vulnerability cascaded down to new hires and became part of our culture.\nI learned a lot at Stratasan. Every year or so my job description completely changed. There are some things that I would have done differently. As an engineer, I was used to fast feedback: if you do something silly, hopefully you have some unit tests that fail and you go fix it. Management is completely different. When you do something stupid, sometimes you don\u0026rsquo;t know just how stupid it was for weeks or even months. When I did make a mistake, I tried to learn from it.2\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next for me? I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure. At this time, I have many personal things that require my attention, so I am taking a pause to reassess my priorities and decide what I want to spend my time on next. One thing I do know that I\u0026rsquo;d like to do again is write, so that\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;ve set this up.\nSee you next time!\nI wrote a 10-year retrospective of my time at Stratasan here\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nI enjoyed McArdle\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Up Side of Down\u0026rdquo;.
