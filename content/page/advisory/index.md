## Background

I got started programming in the mid 90's. Before graduating high school I started my first job as a programmer writing Java servlets for an electronic medical records company. I made $7 an hour, but I was hooked on building products that were viable (they solved a problem) and valuable (someone was willing to pay for it). After graduating college with a Business degree, I struck out on my own as a contractor and consultant. I did a wide variety of work for companies all of the country but really found my groove getting involved in startups and early-stage companies.

Eventually, I found myself in Nashville and co-founded Stratasan with Jason Moore. We grew to almost 100 employees with an average annual revenue growth rate of 30%. I went from solo engineer to engineering lead to engineering manager and the lead of leads. We were acquired by Syntellis Performance Solutions in 2022.

Currently, I leverage the wide array of experience I have in the startup world to provide technical advice to other startups and early-stage companies.
