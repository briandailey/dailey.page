Hi! 👋🏻 My name is Brian and I'm an engineering lead, technology advisor, and
community member of Nashville, Tennessee. My family (wife and five kids) have
called Nashville home since 2009. Previously, we lived in Queens, NY.

I have an extensive background in software engineering, engineering leaderhship,
healthcare technology, product management, security and compliance, and business
strategy. You can read more about my technology advisor work
[here](/technical-advisory).

You can often find me on the [NashDev](https://nashdev.com/) or
the [Rands
Leadership](https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/) Slack
groups.
