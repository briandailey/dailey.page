After wrapping up more than a decade at Stratasan, I'm now working with startup
and early stage companies as an advisor as well as providing technical due
diligence to investors. My work is performed with [Creo Advisory,
LLC](https://creollc.co).

## Advisory Work

While at [Stratasan](/p/hello-world) I found myself doing a lot of things I
hadn't done before (as one does when you grow a company from two to about
a hundred employees). Going from engineer to lead engineer to manager to manager
of managers meant that about every two years my job description changed
drastically.

To keep up, I did an inordinate amount of reading. I also relied heavily on
discussions with peers. One thing that I found extremely useful was finding
trusted advisors to work with. They served as both experienced voices and
trusted soundboards. Often I had an idea of what I needed to do, I just needed
to walk through it with someone and have them tell me, "Yeah, that makes sense.
No, you're not crazy." Having an advisor not otherwise tied to the company would
also extract me from the day-to-day grind and help me see the larger strategy.
In short, I found having advisors to be very valuable.

I've also _served_ as an advisor to other companies. Given how engaged I was at
Stratasan, I could not do this as much as I would have liked. Post-exit, I have
more time to devote to this.

One interesting thing about advisors is that the same advisor is not always
useful in every situation. Each time I found a good advisor, there was a process
of determining the subject matter expertise I needed most (product management?
security/compliance? engineering?) and reviewing potential candidates for
personality fit. I have worked with some folks who I was able to help for a time
and after a while they no longer needed what I could provide. Advisor
relationships are rarely permanent, and it's important for the advisor and
advisee to know when it's no longer worth the investment of time.

## Technical Due Diligence

I've been through a handful of technical due diligence processes. During each
one, I always thought about ways to make it easier on the prospective company.
They varied from "Wow, that felt entirely cursory" to "Holy smokes, this goes
into a very unnecessary level of detail!" I hope to leverage this experience to
run a technical due diligence process that minimizes the time necessary from the prospective
company as well as maximizing usefulness for the investor or acquiring company.

## What makes _you_ qualified?

That's a fair question! There are a couple attributes that make both an advisor or technical reviewer successful:

1. *A wide base of underlying experience.* I have worked in technology since
   2000, giving me almost a quarter of a century of experience across a wide
   array of startups across many technology stacks and industries.
   Much of what I've learned about successfully running
   teams is applicable to pretty much any industry independent of the specific
   technology stack.
1. *A history as an operator.* Many consultants and advisors purport to have
   some kind of system or process that will resolve all your business problems
   (the proverbial "silver bullet"). Rarely do these folks have _actual
   experience operating a business._ The best advisors and investors that I've
   worked with all had prior experience as an operator.

## Ideal project?

Given my experience, I'm better suited to working as an advisor or doing
technical diligence on startup and early stage companies with 5-100 employees.
My domain expertise is heavily in healthcare and my technical experience is
focused predominately on open-source stacks.
