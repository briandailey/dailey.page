A few weeks ago, I asked on LinkedIn [why there aren't more companies in the
Southeast started by
engineers](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/briandailey_why-arent-more-companies-in-the-southeast-activity-7138218767964098560-Dksp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).
It prompted a lot of great conversations both online and offline. **The tl;dr: I'm
starting a group in Nashville for engineers-turned-entrepreneurs. You can sign
up or read more about the details at [techfounder.community](https://techfounder.community).**

## What is the Tech Founder Community?

Taken from [the website](https://techfounder.community):

> The goal of this community is to encourage and enable engineers to leverage
> their technical and domain expertise to build a thriving business. We do this
> by connecting interested folks in local networks with peers, mentors, advisors,
> and maybe even capital.

## Nashville already has a lot of startup-type groups. Why one more?

The short version: existing support networks in Nashville do not target
engineering audiences.

Nashville does have a lot of great things going for it. Programs like the
[Nashville Entpreneur Center Pre-Flight](https://www.ec.co/programs/preflight/)
and [Inflight](https://www.ec.co/programs/inflight/) programs are really great
ways to support growing businesses. However, this tends to support either
business development types (think MBA graduates) or domain experts. This tends
to lead to a lot of business founders looking for "technical co-founders", often
in exchange for sweat equity[^sweat].

There's also a very active engineering community in Nashville. Many of them have
either launched their own business or have considered doing so. According to one
survey from Packt in 2018, [1 in 3 software developers hope to found their own
company](https://hub.packtpub.com/developers-want-to-become-entrepreneurs-make-successful-transition/).

The phenomenon of engineer-turned-entrepreneur is embraced in many coastal
cities, but this simply isn't the case in middle America. I want to change that,
at least for Nashville, by providing a peer support network, veteran mentors,
and more. We can leverage existing infrastructure (like the EC) where
appropriate but focus on enabling and encouraging folks with a technical
background.

## What makes you think you're qualified to host this group?

- I'm both an engineer and entrepreneur. I started writing software
  professionally in 2000, and started my first company in 2004. I co-founded
  [Stratasan](https://www.prweb.com/releases/stratasan-named-technology-market-mover-at-2021-next-awards-829924504.html)
  in 2011, grew it to about 100 people, and then
  [exited](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220711005292/en/Syntellis-Performance-Solutions-to-Acquire-Stratasan-Expanding-Healthcare-Data-Analytics-Capabilities)
  in 2022.
- I'm a big fan of the "open concept" meetups. I was an active participant in
  [OpenCoffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCoffee_Club) circa 2008 (that's
  me in the center of a photo on [Fred Wilson's blog](https://avc.com/2008/04/meetups/)).
  I've seen how useful these informal groups can be in encouraging an ecosystem
  of peer support.
- I have experience managing communities. In fact, I met my wife on such a
  community (that I started) back in the mid-90s (that's some nerd-cred,
  right?). When I moved from engineer to manager, I started a monthly breakfast
  group for engineers-turned-managers ten years ago.

## Why now, in 2024?

- **The macroeconomic big picture.**
    - We're in a weird time. The tech economy is struggling. Due to lay-offs,
      a lot of engineers have some free time on their hands.
      Some of them have fairly nice severance packages. What better time to dip your
      toes into entrepreneurship?
    - With all of the tech lay-offs, many of us are wondering how we can control
      our own destiny. You've poured your heart into a company. The upside is
      the company does well and you make someone else a lot of money. The
      downside is you get unceremoniously cut when the economy lags (or
      management makes poor decisions).[^decisions] "Job stability" is not so
      much, so you might as well roll the dice and potentially see some upside.
    - [Economic slowdowns are the time to start a
      company!](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4298934)
- **COVID19 made many re-evaluate what they're doing.** Some have chosen to
  prioritize lifestyle changes (reduced working hours). Few companies are
  willing to hire folks at less than 40 hours a week, so that narrows options
  down to starting your own thing.

## I'm interested, where do I sign up?

If you're interested and in Nashville, go to [the Tech Founder Community
website](https://techfounder.community) and find the "Sign up" link. You'll also
find additional information on the vision for this and the approach I'm taking.


[^sweat]: Given that an experienced software developer can (often) bring home a
six figure salary, sweat equity often does not make sense. An experienced
software developer still has overhead expenses to pay (housing, healthcare,
etc).
[^decisions]: I have had a lot of conversations with entrepreneurs who worked
under poor management and it made them think, "I could do better job running a
company than these knuckleheads." Prove it!
