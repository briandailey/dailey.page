(WIP)

As I am nearing the end of my tenure at the company I co-founded a decade ago, I
thought it would be useful to share some of the books that were influential to
me as I went from engineer to a lead-of-leads.

## [_Code Complete_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4845.Code_Complete) by Steve McConnell

This book probably feels a bit dated as it was published in 2004. However, I
found this very useful early in my engineering career as I was learning to build
systems that were maintainable and useful. Some of the maxims that McConnell
included in this book are true no matter the language. For example, "write
programs for people first, computers second." I often had a tendency to get
clever with code rather than trying to be blindingly obvious; being clever
tended to produce more pain (both for myself and others) down the road.

## [_The Mythical Man Month: Essays on Software Engineering_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13629.The_Mythical_Man_Month) by Fred Brooks

![Mythical Man Month](mythical-man-month.jpg)

This book makes "Code Complete" feel quite young as "Mythical" was written in 1975. However, it's commentary on software development is still timeless (if one can overlook some of the underlying sexism prevalent at the time). Two essays stuck with me more than others.

["There's No Silver Bullet"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet) highlighted accidental complexity versus essential complexity. Much work has been done to address accidental complexity (especially since 1975!) but essential complexity, the complexity of the underlying problems that we're trying to solve, will always be with us. This one stuck with me because non-engineering types are _constantly_ enamoured by "silver bullets" - whether it's data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or whatever is coming next. Whenever they come upon a hard problem they ask, "Why don't we just use [the silver bullet]?" Even engineers like myself can fall prey to this way of thinking.

In ["The Mythical Man Month"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month#The_mythical_man-month) Brooks asserts that "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later." He highlights the importance of team communication in complex projects and provides a formula to demonstrate that more people means more and more communication overhead. I've heard this described by someone else as "clinks versus drinks." If you sit at a bar with three people, you clink three times and then you can drink. But as you add more and more people to the party, all of your time is spent clinking with very little time for drinking!

## [_The Nature of Software Development_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25254918-the-nature-of-software-development) by Ron Jeffries

![The Nature of Software Development](nature-of-software-development.jpg)

Ron Jeffries is one of the original signatories of the [agile
manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/). The manifesto has been pillaged and
plundered by consultants until it has become [something completely
unrecognizable](https://scaledagileframework.com/) from the original intent.
This book brings it all back home. We're just here to deliver value to our
customers!

The Stratasan and product and engineering teams read this as a group at least
twice. I found it to be extremely useful to help everyone get on the same page
about how a product-first company delivers value to customers. It helped us use
similar vocabulary ("tall and skinnies!" meaning high value, low cost). This
book was particularly useful because it explains the _process_ of software
development so well that you don't actually need to be a developer to understand
it. That makes it much more useful for development-adjacent roles like product
management, QA, etc.

## [_Inspired_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35249663-inspired) by Marty Cagan and Chris Jones

Speaking of product management, this book and "[Empowered](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55954021-empowered)
are aimed more at product managers. Cagan kept being recommended to me by smart
people, and once I read them I wished I had done so sooner. The Stratasan team
read both of these books as a group and I found them to be extremely helpful to
communicate what I meant when I said "let's be a product-first company."

If "The Nature of Software Development" was a good introduction to software
development for product managers, "Inspired" was a great introduction to product
management for software developers.
