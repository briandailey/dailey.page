I've been doing the [fractional CTO (fCTO)
thing](/p/wide-world-of-the-fractional-cto/) for about [two
years](/p/2024-in-retro/) now, and I
get quite a few people who ask me about how I got things started. Given the
[rapid reduction in available software development-related
positions](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE), it makes
sense that there are quite a few who are considering [hanging out a
shingle](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/hang+out+shingle).

I enjoy discussing this with folks, but my policy on these things is that if I
find myself repeating the same material, I should probably save myself and
everyone else a lot of time by just writing it down! This is my attempt to do
that.

Much of this advice on getting started is really applicable to anyone doing any
kind of consulting.

# How should I get started?

## Have the experience.

I don't have data on this, but I get the sense that the demand for fractional
leadership has gone up since 2022. Supply has risen to meet that demand.
However, a fair portion of the supply (of fractional leaders) has never actually been in a leadership
position. When I ask clients why they choose to work with me, many of them
have pointed at my experience as both a founder and a leader. A
departmental manager at BigCorp might carve out a reputation as a team leader,
but someone with very little (or no) prior leadership experience might find it
difficult to find a toehold in a crowded market.

## Find a niche.

One common issue I see with folks getting started is that they make no
real attempts at defining where they can truly add value. I get that it's
tempting to do All The Things when you first get started - after all, you need
to get paid and eat! If you specify a niche (industry, stage of
company, B2B or B2C, SaaS or otherwise, or some combination of these things)
you can start to figure out who you should be marketing and talking to. Speaking
of talking...

## Talk to a lot of people.

I get it, sales is hard (especially if you are an introverted engineer-type like
me), but if you're going solo then you're also the salesperson.

The easiest way to figure out how many conversations you need to have is to
take some notes from the SaaS sales playbook. First, figure out what your annual
revenue target is. Next, determine what your average fractional engagement will
net you. (If you're just getting started, it's going to be fuzzy math, but
that's ok! You can adjust this as you get more information.) Keep all of your
opportunities in a CRM (HubSpot's free tier is pretty good for a solo operation)
and use that information to determine what ratio of conversations you have to
close an engagement. Your sample size may be rather small, but again, fuzzy math
is okay.

For myself, I've found that I need to have maybe 2-3 conversations a week with
various folks in my industry. Those are not sales conversations, and they
are very unlikely to end in an engagement. But if I'm having conversations with
the right people, each meeting is a person who might know someone else needing
my help. They could be a source for a warm lead.

## Have some sample proposals (and deliverables) ready.

I have found it to be useful to have several different sample proposals on hand.
It provides potential clients with an idea of how I approach engagements (clear
terms, flat rates, etc) and makes them more comfortable with the idea of working
with me.

## Start with projects before going open-ended.

For me, fCTO engagements are completely open-ended. I'm only taking on two
clients at a time, and generally they are a day or two (sometimes more) per week
in, for which I am billing a weekly rate. However, that's a lot to sign on for
if you've not worked with me before.

To establish trust, I'll often start a relationship with a well-defined project.
Having a well-scoped project with a discrete (written) deliverable familiarizes
clients with my working style (and me with theirs).

## Keep the pipeline going.

If you pick up one or two projects, it's easy to get so involved in them that
you forget to keep talking to folks about potential future projects. When you
finish the project, you don't want to be in a mad scramble to find your next
engagement.


# What do _not_ you like about being a Fractional CTO?

## You do all the things.

Sales. Marketing. Accounting. Bill collection. As a solo practioner, you do _all
the things_. That eats into the time that you'll spend doing the thing you love,
but it's part of the deal!

## Staying fresh requires intentionality.

You'll no doubt learn new things just engaging with clients, but to stay on top
of industry trends (both technology and whatever domain you're working in) you
will have to allocate some time to ongoing self-education. It's easy to skip
this part, but don't! Your continued usefulness _depends_ on staying current.

## You trade depth for breadth.

When you're consulting, you rarely get to spend enough time with one
project (maybe 3-6 months for most of my engagements) to go really deep. Instead, you
get exposed to a broad array of industry niches, architectures, languages, and
product categories.

There's a trade-off here. I enjoyed going deep for 13 years (from first line of
code to exit) with Stratasan. I also enjoy the variety inherent to consulting.
Ideally, one could switch between depth and breadth every 5-7 years.

## There will be juggling.

I take on no more than two fractional engagements at any time due to this. I
also stress to potential clients that it's _fractional_, not _interim._ This
means I am not always immediately available, but I do clearly communicate
my availability with all clients via Calendly.

# What do you love about fractional leadership?

## I love strategy.

As a fractional chief _technology_ officer, I would presumably be working on
engineering strategy. However, I find that when I start asking questions I often
start edging into _business strategy_, which I love. There's nothing more
satisfying to me than a client asking me to sit in on one of their annual or
quarterly strategic planning sessions!

## I love the autonomy.

I get to choose the clients I work with, and I'm fairly picky about it. I only
want to work with companies that I feel I can provide an unusual level of value
(e.g., sticking to my niche of early-ish stage healthcare B2B SaaS). That makes
the work both more satisfying to me and more valuable to my clients.

## I love the security.

Assuming you are able to keep the pipeline going, there's a lot more security in
having six or seven ongoing clients (between fractional CTO, advisory, and
project work) rather than putting all your eggs in one basket for a single
company.

## I love the variety.

I get bored fairly easily, so I love it when I can hit several interesting
engagements in a single year. They will probably be in healthcare, but they
could otherwise be completely unlike (different technology stacks, different
business problems, different company cultures and problems they are facing). I
thrive on this variety.

# Parting Thoughts

If you have an appetite for it, I believe fractional leadership can be very
fulfilling.

If you're thinking about striking out as an fCTO, there are a lot of resources
already out there to get you going. You don't have to learn everything from
scratch!
