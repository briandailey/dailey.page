I have a love/hate relationship with LinkedIn. It is full of useless noise, but
it's a great way to keep up with colleagues and interesting people working in my
field. Here are two major frustrations with the platform that diminish its
utility to me.

- Like most social media, the signal-to-noise ratio on LinkedIn is quite low.
  Most posts are either self-congratulatory, AI slop, or simply some variation
  of an existing Business Meme ("I replaced an entire team of developers with
  AI!" "SaaS is dead!" etc). I wish I could filter my feed down to a subset of
  users that I find actually informative. For example, [Shreyas
  Doshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyasdoshi/) either writes or shares
  excellent content around product management. [Ed
  Melendez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardmelendez/) constantly posts a
  highly eclectic variety of things I find interesting. I can follow both of
  these people, but since the Feed is algorithmic, I might not see anything they
  post for days or weeks and it will be surrounded by useless slop. There's no
  way to build an RSS feed for an individual's LinkedIn
  activity, so I am simply at the mercy of the almighty algorithm as to when or
  where I might see these posts. It probably doesn't help that as a long-time
  LinkedIn user I'm connected to thousands of users, making my Feed particularly
  noisy.
- Let's say I do see something interesting in my Feed and I leave the post for
  another page. When I return to the feed (via a browser "Back" button)
  everything in my Feed is reshuffled and the original item is lost in the
  abyss. This is particularly frustrating on a
  mobile device where I might be scrolling through the Feed, be interrupted by
  an email or something. When I return to the Feed, the page automatically
  reloads, losing everything I was looking at and giving me a whole new set of
  slop to scroll through.

All in all, I still find LinkedIn useful enough that I continue to visit it on a
fairly regular basis (while successfully ignoring most of the notifications).

I still consume most of my content via old-school RSS (via Feedly) and wish that
LinkedIn would make it easier for users to publish content to publicly
accessible feeds. It makes sense that they would want a walled garden with
algorithm-driven content (I assume "time on site" is some Director's KPI) but
this approach continues to diminish the utility of any content posted on
LinkedIn.

Due to this conflict of incentives, my approach is to post (most) everything I
write both on LinkedIn and on my blog.
