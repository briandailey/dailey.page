# 2024 Retrospective (Creo)

When I ended my time at Stratasan in March of 2023, my original goal was to stick to a lighter working schedule that allowed me to spend more time with my (rather large-ish) family. After committing over a decade to a startup, I was ready for a change of pace for a time.

I had two major themes in mind coming into 2024:

- Make "small bets" on side projects that might gain traction (either on my own or with a business partner).
- Leverage my experience in the healthcare B2B SaaS (yes, it's very specific) sector to earn income.

In 2024, my only "small bet" was Calendaristic. I spent more time in the first quarter of the year on this than any other quarter. As my consulting work (under [Creo Advisory](https://creollc.co)) became more demanding, side projects became more difficult to focus on.

What else happened in 2024, broadly speaking?

- I co-founded the [Nashville CTO Club](https://nashvillectoclub.com) with Josh Segall and Jim Siegienski.
- I started [Tech Founder Community](https://techfounder.community) to try to connect with other engineering founders and co-founders.
- I connected with a _lot_ of people in 2024. I continue to believe that this is the primary way that serendipity strikes. According to Google Calendar, I met with over 400 people in 2024. Calendly was a life-saver here.
    - Many conversations started off with a meeting at some local event (Haley Zapolski and Josh Segall hosted many of these) or events at the Nashville Entrepreneur Center.
    - A good many of these were referral from folks I have worked with or for in the past. Referrals are the best compliment I can receive!

## What went well?

- The Nashville CTO Club got off to a _great_ start in September. Kudos to Mr. Segall for being the primary driver of this thing. It's obvious that Josh hosts a lot of events, because he though of a lot of details that I simply would not have considered. It gave this group needed structure.
- The consulting / fractional business continued to do well. I was able to focus on clients that I felt I offerred the highest value (in my particular niche, relevant to my past experience) and turn down potential work for which I did not feel well-suited. A breakdown of how I billed categories is below.
- I was able to (mostly) stick to a four-day-a-week work schedule, which allowed me to prioritize more time with my family.
- About halfway through the year I found myself doing a lot of interviewing for CTO and VPoE roles (I was the interviewer on behalf of my client). Given that this was somewhat of a rarity when I worked at one company, I used the opportunity to leverage the repitition here in order to improve my interview process. As Annie Dukes said, you can't just gain experience by letting things wash over you; you have to be intentional about it! I feel like intentionally improving on my interviewing skills bore fruit.

## What didn't go well?

- The Tech Founder Community languished. In June, it seemed like a doable thing. In July, baby #6 joined our family and I had forgotten just how much a new baby can take the wind out of your sails (especially in your forties!).
- I spent so much time on Creo Advisory that I failed to get any other side projects off of the ground.

## What are my goals for 2025?

- I will launch three side projects into production in 2025. Two of these are known and in-progress. The third is a TBD.
- I will block off more time for reading and writing. It's easy to spend so much time on the application (consulting, building) that no time is spent learning and reflecting.
- I'll promote useful engagement within the Tech Founder Community, further refining it's purpose and mission.

## Other Thoughts

Presumably, I'm often hired as fractional CTO to help with the engineering team. But often I find that I spend more time with company leadership thinking about business strategy. Business strategy affects engineering strategy and vice versa. This is something that I enjoyed and would love to do more of. However, I'm not really sure if I want to market myself as some kind of strategic advisor!

## Bonus: Favorite business-related books of the year?

This one is easy! [Everything is Predictable](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199798096-everything-is-predictable?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=ptdQJPGaYc&rank=1) by Tom Chivers and [Thinking in Bets](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35957157-thinking-in-bets) by Annie Dukes. The former I found via [Five Books](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/best-popular-science-books-2024-royal-society-book-prize-john-hutchison/) and the latter was via a conversation with [Prakesh Sripathy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prakashsripathy/). I am a fan of being uncertain and both of these books help think through uncertainty. I'll write more about these too books later!
